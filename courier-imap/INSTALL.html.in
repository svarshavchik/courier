  <h2><a name="upgrading" id="upgrading">UPGRADING</a></h2>
  <h3>Upgrading from Courier-IMAP 4.18.2, and earlier</h3>
  <p>Courier-IMAP 5.0 added IMAP UTF8 support, and converted
  maildir folders' names to Unicode. Updating an existing system to
  Courier-IMAP 5.0, and later, requires a manual one-time
  conversion of all existing maildirs using the
  <code>maildirmake</code> command. See the <a href=
  "https://www.courier-mta.org/maildirmake.html">maildirmake(1)</a>
  manual page for more information.</p>
  <p>NOTE: If <a target="_blank" href=
  "https://www.courier-mta.org/cone/index.html">Cone</a> is
  installed, Cone also must be updated to 0.97, or later.</p>
  <h3>Upgrading from Courier-IMAP 4.14, and earlier</h3>
  <p>Version 4.15 removes the TLS_DHCERTFILE parameter from imap,
  and pop3d configuration files. DH parameters, and DH parameters
  only, get read from the new TLS_DHPARAMS file (and the other
  functionaly of TLS_DHCERTFILE, for DSA certificates, is merged
  into TLS_CERTFILE). After upgrading, run the
  <code>mkdhparams</code> script to create a new TLS_DHPARAMS
  file.</p>
  <h3>Upgrading from Courier-IMAP 4.9.3, and earlier</h3>
  <p>In 4.10.0, the IMAP server resets the epoch for an internal
  sequence number generator for new mailboxes. This is an internal
  attribute of individual IMAP folders, that's defined by the IMAP
  specification. Each folder in a mailbox carries an individual
  sequence number, it is defined as a 32 bit integer value, and
  required to be a monotonically increasing value. and RFC 2060
  recommended that "... a good value to use for the unique
  identifier validity value is a 32-bit representation of the
  creation date/time of the mailbox."</p>
  <p>On modern platforms, the system time is now a 64 bit value
  (even on the remaining 32 bit platforms). With Y2038K on the
  horizon, it's time to reset the epoch (the new epoch, for anyone
  who cares, runs until the year 2069). The upgrade impact on
  existing systems is as follows.</p>
  <p>There is no impact on existing folders in existing mailboxes.
  New folders will have their internal sequence number in the new
  epoch.</p>
  <p>One potential issue exists if a folder gets deleted by the
  IMAP client, and then recreated later. The new folder will now
  get a lower sequence number. Although this is technically not
  allowed, it's unlikely to cause problems with most IMAP clients.
  If the same IMAP client deletes and recreated the mailbox, the
  client should be completely up to speed. If, however, there's an
  IMAP client that accesses the same folder, and some other IMAP
  client deletes and recreates the same folder, this might cause
  confusion. Most IMAP clients are likely to recover automatically;
  most IMAP clients only care that the new sequence number they see
  is different from the previous one, in order to trigger a full
  resynchronization with the server. In case an IMAP client fails
  to resynchronize, the remedy is to remove the IMAP account
  configuration from the client, and add it back in.</p>
  <p>Copying a mailbox by directly copying the files in maildirs
  preserves each folder's epoch. However if a mailbox gets migrated
  by copying its contents over IMAP, the folders on the destination
  IMAP server will not necessarily have a monotonically higher
  value -- neither does IMAP guarantee that different IMAP servers
  must be in agreement with each other on the subject of sequence
  numbers -- and if IMAP clients are repointed to a new server they
  may experience problems opening existing mailboxes. To remedy
  this situation it will be necessary to completely remove and then
  reconfigure the IMAP account, in the IMAP client. Again, verbatim
  copying of maildirs has no issues.</p>
  <p>A marginal situation exists where if a server completely runs
  of disk space, or if there's a hardware failure, and the IMAP
  server is unable to retrieve or save an existing folder's
  sequence number, and must now start afresh and generate a new
  one, the IMAP server running on a new epoch will recover with a
  lower sequence than the one that existed before. The rememdy is
  the same: remove the IMAP account configuration from the client,
  and then recreate it.</p>
  <h3>Upgrading from Courier-IMAP 3, and earlier.</h3>
  <p>Beginning with 4.0, the authentication library that used to be
  a part of Courier-IMAP's source has been spun off into a
  standalone authentication library.</p>
  <p>You must download and install the Courier Authentication
  Library from <a href=
  "https://www.courier-mta.org/authlib/">https://www.courier-mta.org/authlib/</a>
  before upgrading. Review the documentation in the
  <code>courier-authlib</code> package for more information.</p>
  <p>After upgrading to 4.0, or later, to avoid future confusion
  the old copies of these configuration files (including the
  <code>.dist</code> files), should be removed from Courier-IMAP's
  configuration directory. They now live in Courier-authlib's
  configuration directory (<code>/usr/local/etc/authlib</code>, or
  whatever was specified to Courier-authlib's
  <code>configure</code> script).</p>
  <h3>Upgrading from Courier-IMAP 1.7.3, and earlier.</h3>
  <p>After upgrading from Courier-IMAP 1.7.3, or earlier, any
  existing mail in POP3 mailboxes may show up as new mail, by some
  mail clients. Other mail clients may end up downloading a second
  copy of any message that was left in the mailbox before the
  upgrade. This is a one-time event. Courier-IMAP 2.0.0 uses a
  different mechanism for generating POP3 message identifiers. Mail
  clients that use POP3 identifiers will behave as if all messages,
  that were left in the POP3 mailbox before the upgrade, were
  removed, and replaced by new messages that happen to be the same
  content. Depending on how the POP3 mail client works, it will
  either flag all messages in the mailbox as unread, or download a
  second copy of the message.</p>
  <p>Upgrading from Courier-IMAP 1.3.0, and later versions, is a
  straightforward process. Follow the instructions in the <a href=
  "#install">INSTALLATION</a> section, below, to install the new
  version. The "<code>make install-configure</code>" command
  automatically preserves the existing system configuration.
  However, note that new versions of Courier-IMAP will often
  introduce additional configuration options. After <code>make
  install-configure</code> a cursory inspection of configuration
  files in <code>@defaultprefix@/etc</code> (the default location
  of the configuration directory) is recommended, in order to
  identify any new configuration settings that might need
  adjustment.</p>
  <h3>Upgrading from Courier-IMAP 1.3.8.2 and earlier</h3>
  <p>The default configuration options have slightly changed. The
  default configuration script will now always build the
  <code>authdaemon</code> module, and build all real authentication
  modules inside <code>authdaemond</code>. This is true even with
  the <code>authvchkpw</code> module.</p>
  <h3>Upgrading from Courier-IMAP 1.2.3 and earlier</h3>
  <p>Courier-IMAP 1.3.0 introduced a new configuration file format
  that allows configuration files to be automatically upgraded.
  Additionally, several existing configuration files have been
  renamed in order for their names to be consistent with the
  Courier build:</p>
  <pre>
Courier-IMAP &lt; 1.3  Courier-IMAP 1.3.0
--------            ---------
imapd.config        imapd
imapd-ssl.config    imapd-ssl
pop3d.config        pop3d
pop3d-ssl.config    pop3d-ssl
</pre>
  <p>The NEWS file has a detailed explanation of how configuration
  files are now installed. Basically, <code>make install</code> now
  installs <code>configfilename.dist</code>, and <code>make
  install-configure</code> copies <code>configfilename.dist</code>
  to <code>configfilename</code>, becoming the actual configuration
  file. If there is an existing <code>configfilename</code>, the
  old settings in <code>configfilename</code> which are still valid
  will be kept in the new <code>configfilename</code>.</p>
  <p>This only works as long as both the old and the new
  configuration files are in the new format, so this will actually
  take effect with your next upgrade Courier-IMAP. If the previous
  installed version of Courier-IMAP did not use the new format for
  configuration files (1.2.3 and earlier), the old configuration
  file is backed up to <code>configfilename.bak</code>.</p>
  <p>The recommended procedure for upgrading from versions 1.2.3
  and earlier is as follows:</p>
  <p>The recommended upgrade procedure is as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Back up <code>@defaultprefix@/etc</code></li>
    <li>Follow the installation procedures, below</li>
    <li>After installing, manually edit all configuration files.
    Restore, by hand, any custom configuration settings.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All configuration files are kept in the configuration
  directory. Nothing else in <code>@defaultprefix@</code> is
  configurable. Do not simply overwrite 1.3.0 configuration files
  with configuration files from the previous version. It's
  tempting, but don't do it. It may work, but you will lose the
  automatic upgrade capability for future releases.</p>
  <h3>Upgrading from Courier-IMAP 1.1 or earlier</h3>
  <p>Note that Courier-IMAP 1.2 includes a compatible POP3 server,
  and the installation script will also install a POP3 server on
  your system. Even though it is installed, you are not required to
  use it, but you still need to be aware of its existence. If you
  install the RPM build of Courier-IMAP, you're going to get the
  POP3 server started at system boot. If you do not need POP3
  services, edit both the <code>pop3d.config</code> and
  <code>pop3d-ssl.config</code> configuration files, and set
  <code>POP3DSTART</code> and <code>POP3DSSLSTART</code> to NO</p>
  <h3>Upgrading from Courier-IMAP 1.0 or earlier</h3>
  <p>If the server is running, manually stop the server before
  installing the new version.</p>
  <h2><a name="install" id="install">INSTALLATION</a></h2>
  <p>To compile and install the Courier-IMAP server (this is the
  short version, a longer version follows):</p>
  <pre>

$ ./configure [ options, see below ]
$ make
$ make check       # Note - the --enable-workarounds-for-imap-client-bugs
                   # option to configure will result in make check FAILING.
$ su root
# make install     # Or, make install-strip, to strip the executables.
# make install-configure   # Install configuration files.

                   # Start the authdaemond process
</pre>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>NOTE</b></p>
    <p>You MUST run the <code>configure</code> script as normal
    user, not root. Did you extract the tarball as root? It won't
    work. Remove the extracted source code. Log in as a normal
    user. Extract the source code as a normal user, then run
    <code>configure</code>. You will do everything as a normal
    user, except for the final step of installing the compiled
    software.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>NOTE</b></p>
    <p>Courier-IMAP does not use <code>inetd</code> or
    <code>xinetd</code>. Any <code>inetd</code> or
    <code>xinetd</code> configuration settings for the IMAP and
    POP3 ports must be turned off. Courier-IMAP will not start if
    <code>inetd</code> or <code>xinetd</code> is listening for IMAP
    or POP3 connections.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <hr />
  <p>As mentioned in "Requirements", above, if you are using xBSD,
  you must use gmake instead of make.</p>
  <hr />
  <p>NOTE: The <code>configure</code> script may run as much as
  5-10 minutes on slow machines. It may appear that
  <code>configure</code> is stuck in a loop, but that's an
  illusion. Courier-IMAP is built from a collection of modular
  components, each with its own configuration script. The
  configuration scripts share a lot of common code, leading to an
  initial impression that the same configuration script is being
  repeatedly run.</p>
  <p>See below for a description of the options to the
  <code>configure</code> script.</p>
  <p><b>WARNING:</b> set your umask to 022 before running
  <code>make install</code> or <code>make install-strip</code>.</p>
  <p>You should try <code>make install-strip</code> first. Use
  <code>make install</code> if <code>make install-strip</code>
  fails.</p>
  <p>The configure script accepts certain options, but the defaults
  should be fine most of the time. <code>make install</code> puts
  everything in <code>@defaultprefix@</code>. If the directory
  <code>/etc/pam.d</code> exists, <code>make install</code> creates
  <code>/etc/pam.d/imap</code> and <code>/etc/pam.d/pop3</code>,
  overwriting any existing files. If you have some other IMAP
  server installed, this means that you will want to save your
  existing configuration in
  <code>/etc/pam.d/{imap|pop3}</code>.</p>
  <p>"<code>make check</code>" performs some internal sanity
  checks. If <code>make check</code> fails, something is wrong, and
  Courier-IMAP may not work for you reliably. Certain options are
  documented to cause <code>make check</code> to fail, due to
  different IMAP protocol behavior. If you need to use those
  options, first compile Courier-IMAP without them, run make check,
  and if all goes well extract the source code again in a different
  directory, then build it for the second time using your
  options.</p>
  <p>After installation, you will need to review the files in
  <code>@defaultprefix@/etc</code> and make any changes you deem
  necessary.</p>
  <p>After running <code>make install</code> or <code>make
  install-strip</code> you will then have to modify your system's
  startup scripts to run Courier-IMAP when your system boots.</p>
  <p>Use the following command to start the Courier-IMAP
  server:</p>
  <pre>

$ @defaultprefix@/libexec/imapd.rc start
</pre>
  <p>This assumes that Courier-IMAP is installed in
  <code>@defaultprefix@</code>. Use the following command to stop
  Courier-IMAP:</p>
  <pre>

$ @defaultprefix@/libexec/imapd.rc stop
</pre>
  <p>You will have to add these commands to your system
  startup/shutdown scripts.</p>
  <h4>IMAP over SSL</h4>
  <p>To add SSL support you have to install OpenSSL or GnuTLS
  before installing Courier-IMAP. Download OpenSSL from <a target=
  "_blank" href=
  "http://www.openssl.org/"><code>http://www.openssl.org/</code></a>,
  or GnuTLS from <a target="_blank" href=
  "http://www.gnutls.org"><code>http://www.gnutls.org</code></a>.</p>
  <p>Follow OpenSSL's or GnuTLS's installation instructions, then
  build Courier-IMAP.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>NOTE:</b> Most systems already have an available OpenSSL
    or GnuTLS package. Do not build OpenSSL or GnuTLS yourself, if
    a prebuilt package is already available. Just install the
    prebuilt package.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>NOTE:</b> The development libraries must be installed in
    addition to the runtime package, in order to build
    Courier-IMAP. On most systems, the development files (header
    files, libraries, etc...) are provided in a separate "devel"
    package. The base OpenSSL/GnuTLS package is not sufficient to
    build Courier-IMAP, the development libraries must be
    installed.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The OpenSSL library is selected when both OpenSSL and GnuTLS
  libraries are found by the <code>configure</code> script. Use the
  <code>--with-gnutls</code> option to explicitly select the GnuTLS
  library over OpenSSL.</p>
  <p>The <code>@defaultprefix@/etc/imapd-ssl</code> configuration
  file sets some additional options for SSL support, which you may
  need to adjust. Consult that configuration file for additional
  information. Then, you also have to run the
  <code>@defaultprefix@/libexec/imapd-ssl.rc</code> script from
  your system startup and shutdown scripts, just like the
  <code>@defaultprefix@/libexec/imapd.rc</code> script. You may
  accept both SSL and non-SSL connections by running both
  scripts.</p>
  <p>Note that SSL requires a valid, signed, X.509 certificate to
  be installed where Courier-IMAP expects to find it. The default
  location for the X.509 certificate, in PEM format, is
  <code>@defaultprefix@/share/imapd.pem</code>. The X.509
  certificate must be signed by a certificate authority that is
  known to the IMAP client. You can generate your own self-signed
  certificate by running the script
  <code>@defaultprefix@/share/mkimapdcert</code> which will work
  too, except that IMAP clients using SSL will display a warning
  message the first time they connect to the server. To get rid of
  the warning message you'll have to pay for a signed X.509
  certificate. The gory details of setting up SSL is beyond the
  scope of this document, and you should consult the OpenSSL
  documentation for more information.</p>
  <p>The <code>mkimapdcert</code> script will not overwrite an
  existing <code>imapd.pem</code> certificate, in order to allow
  precompiled packages to simply call <code>mkimapdcert</code>
  after installation, without worry.</p>
  <h4>Initial parameters, and a monthly cron job to generate DH
  parameters</h4>
  <p>Run the <code>mkdhparams</code> script to create a DH
  parameter file. A monthly cron job should be created to run the
  <code>mkdhparams</code> script, in order to periodically generate
  a new set of DH parameters. <code>mkdhparams</code> checks if the
  DH parameter file's timestamp is older than 25 days, and creates
  a new file if it is. DH parameters are used to set up encrypted
  connections.</p>
  <h4>The bundled POP3 server</h4>
  <p>The POP3 server included with Courier-IMAP provides POP3
  access to INBOX, and that's about it. Enabling the POP3 server is
  very similar to enabling the IMAP server, with the following
  differences:</p>
  <p>The configuration files are
  <code>@defaultprefix@</code>/etc/pop3dand
  <code>@defaultprefix@</code>/etc/pop3d-ssl.</p>
  <p>The startup/shutdown scripts are
  <code>@defaultprefix@</code>/libexec/pop3d.rcand
  <code>@defaultprefix@</code>/libexec/pop3d-ssl.rc.</p>
  <p>The SSL certificate is
  <code>@defaultprefix@/share/pop3d.pem</code>, and the
  <code>@defaultprefix@/share/mkpop3dcert</code> script can be used
  to create a self-signed SSL certificate for testing purposes.</p>
  <h4>System-V style startup</h4>
  <p>If your system uses System-V style startup scripts, take a
  look at <code>courier-imap.sysvinit</code> - this is a sample
  <code>/etc/init.d</code> script.
  <code>courier-imap.sysvinit</code> is created by
  <code>configure</code>. In most cases it can be merely copied to
  <code>/etc/init.d</code> and <code>/etc/rc?.d</code> directories
  (with the execute permission bit turned on).</p>
  <p>The sample startup script will check if IMAP or POP3 over SSL
  is enabled. The sample startup script automatically creates dummy
  SSL certificates the first time it is executed.</p>
  <h4>Options to <code>configure</code>:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><code>--prefix=pathname</code> - install here, instead of
    <code>@defaultprefix@</code></li>
    <li><code>--without-ipv6</code> - do not compile IPv6 support.
    The <code>configure</code> automatically checks if IPv6 support
    is available, and enables it automatically. This option
    suppresses IPv6 support, even if it's available. IPv6 support
    means that Courier-IMAP will create an IPv6 socket and accept
    IPv6 connections. <code>--without-ipv6</code> should be used if
    your system does not fully support IPv6, or if its
    implementation is buggy. Most Linux distributions now ship with
    IPv6 support in glibc, but without compiling the kernel for
    IPv6 support. This results in <code>modprobe</code> regularly
    complaining in <code>/var/log/messages</code> about the fact
    that it can't load the IPv6 module. Use
    <code>--without-ipv6</code> to turn off IPv6 support, if that
    bothers you.</li>
    <li><code>--bindir=pathname</code> ,
    <code>--mandir=pathname</code> - override default names of
    subdirectories under <code>prefix</code>. See below for more
    information.</li>
    <li><code>--with-db=db</code> - Use the DB library instead of
    the GDBM library You must have either the GDBM or the DB
    library installed. If both are present, GDBM is selected unless
    you use this option. The GDBM/DB library is used by Courier for
    certain functions.</li>
    <li><code>--with-gnutls</code> - Use the GnuTLS library even if
    the OpenSSL library is also installed. Courier-IMAP
    automatically uses whichever one is available. The OpenSSL
    library is selected if both are present. Use this option to
    override and select GnuTLS instead.</li>
    <li><code>--with-piddir=dir</code> - use dir/imapd.pid to store
    couriertcpd's process ID.</li>
    <li><code>--with-userdb=file</code> - use <i>file</i> instead
    of <code>@userdb@</code> (also means that userdb.dat and
    userdbshadow.dat are appropriately renamed).</li>
    <li><code>--enable-workarounds-for-imap-client-bugs</code> -
    there are a number of various bugs in certain IMAP clients. The
    current list of broken IMAP clients consists of Netscape
    Messenger and Sun's StarOffice. This option enables some
    workarounds for some bugs in these clients, however, note that
    this may break compatibility with software that correctly
    implements IMAP4rev1. Additionally, "<code>make check</code>"
    will fail when this option is used. See
    <code>imap/BUGS.(html|txt)</code> for more information. NOTE -
    if this option is used, <code>make check</code> WILL FAIL. You
    should first configure Courier-IMAP without this option, run
    <code>make check</code>, then reconfigure Courier-IMAP with
    this option.</li>
    <li><code>--with-trashquota</code> - include deleted messages,
    and the Trash folder, in the estimated quota usage for
    maildirs. Quotas are optional, see the file
    maildir/README.maildirquota.html for more information. The
    default configuration does not count messages marked as deleted
    (but not yet expunged) and the contents of the Trash folder
    (which are automatically purged by the server) against the
    quota usage. NOTE - if this option is used, <code>make
    check</code> WILL FAIL. You should first configure Courier-IMAP
    without this option, run <code>make check</code>, then
    reconfigure Courier-IMAP with this option.</li>
    <li><code>--with-dirsync</code> - after saving a new message to
    a maildir (the <code>IMAP</code> <code>COPY</code> and
    <code>APPEND</code> commands) explicitly sync the maildir's
    <code>directory</code> directory. There's a school of thought
    which believes that the Linux ext2 filesystem requires the
    parent directory to be synced, in addition to the new message
    file that's just been written to disk. There's another school
    of thought that thinks that this issue is completely blown out
    of proportion, and is really nothing more than a tempest in a
    teapot. However -- to accomodate the former school of thought
    -- this option adds a little bit of extra code to sync the
    parent directory.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Installation directories</h4>
  <p>Unless the options <code>--prefix</code>,
  <code>--bindir</code>, or <code>--mandir</code> are used,
  everything will be installed in the directory
  <code>@defaultprefix@</code>.</p>
  <p>Use the <code>--prefix</code> option to specify a different
  directory. This directory will have the following
  subdirectories:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>etc</code> - configuration files</li>
    <li><code>bin</code> - binaries</li>
    <li><code>sbin</code> - superuser binaries</li>
    <li><code>libexec</code> - additional binaries</li>
    <li><code>man</code> - manual pages</li>
    <li><code>share</code> - scripts and data files</li>
    <li><code>var</code> - temporary files used by the
    <code>authdaemond</code>, daemon process (if the
    <code>authdaemon</code> authentication module is
    selected).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Having everything installed underneath one directory allows
  its contents to be easily backed up, before a newer version of
  <code>courier-imap</code> is installed. Reverting to a previous
  version is as simple as restoring from backup.</p>
  <p>Because some binaries in <code>bin</code> and
  <code>sbin</code> may be executed from the command line, it will
  be necessary to change your systemwide global startup script to
  add this directory to the default <code>PATH</code>.
  Additionally, it will also be necessary to modify the
  configuration of the <code>man(1)</code> command so that it can
  find Courier-IMAP's manual pages in this directory:</p>
  <pre>
        PATH="@defaultprefix@/bin:$PATH"
        if test -w /etc
        then
                PATH="@defaultprefix@/sbin:$PATH"
        fi
        export PATH
        MANPATH="@defaultprefix@/man:$MANPATH"
        export MANPATH
</pre>
  <p>As an alternative, you may use the <code>--bindir</code> and
  <code>--mandir</code> options in order to install binaries to
  <code>/usr/local/bin</code> and the manual pages to
  <code>/usr/local/man</code>, which should already be searched by
  default:</p>
  <pre>
        ./configure --bindir=/usr/local/bin --mandir=/usr/local/man
</pre>
  <p>Other familiar configure options, such as
  <code>--sysconfdir</code> and <code>--datadir</code> work too,
  for those who know how to properly use them.</p>
  <h2><a name="imapconfig" id="imapconfig">Configuration
  file</a></h2>
  <p>The <code>@defaultprefix@/etc/imapd</code> configuration file
  sets some configurable options. Each setting has a brief
  description. Review each setting, and make any necessary
  adjustments.</p>
  <p>The <code>@defaultprefix@/etc/imapd-ssl</code> configuration
  file sets additional configuration setting for the server running
  IMAP over TLS or SSL on port 993. Note that, by default, the
  regular IMAP server on port 143 also supports encrypted
  connections, and the default startup script for the port 143
  server reads both configuration files.</p>
  <p>The <code>@defaultprefix@/etc/pop3d</code> and the
  <code>@defaultprefix@/etc/pop3d-ssl</code> configuration files
  set options of the POP3 server.</p>
  <p>NOTE: the actual location of the configuration file directory
  is itself configured at compilation time.</p>
  <h2><a name="loginexec" id="loginexec">ACCOUNT INITIALIZATION
  HOOK</a></h2>
  <p>If there is a file or a symbolic link in the maildir called
  "loginexec", and if it is executable, then the executable file
  will be invoked after a succesful login. If the program
  terminates with an exit code of 0, the "loginexec" file (or a
  symbolic link) will be removed.</p>
  <h2><a name="shared" id="shared">USING SHARED FOLDERS</a></h2>
  <p>Courier-IMAP supports shared folders. See the file <a href=
  "README.sharedfolders.html"><code>README.sharedfolders.html</code></a>
  for information on how to set up shared folders.</p>
  <h2><a name="crammd5" id="crammd5">CRAM-MD5
  AUTHENTICATION</a></h2>
  <p>CRAM-MD5 authentication allows IMAP clients to authenticate
  themselves without sending the password in clear-text over the
  network. Courier-IMAP now supports CRAM-MD5 by default, but is
  not enabled for reasons explained below. CRAM-MD5 support is
  implemented by the <code>authcram</code> module, with one
  exception - <code>authldap</code>, <code>authpgsql</code>, and
  <code>authmysql</code> support CRAM-MD5 authentication if the
  LDAP or the MySQL/PostgreSQL server stores clear-text passwords,
  and not crypt-ed passwords.</p>
  <p>To use CRAM-MD5 it is necessary to use an IMAP client that
  support CRAM-MD5 authentication, of course. That's the easy
  part.</p>
  <p>The problem is that it is not possible to use the system
  password when logging in using CRAM-MD5. That's because CRAM-MD5
  requires the knowledge of the actual password, in the clear, in
  order to calculate authentication tokens (even though that the
  password itself is not sent in the clear over the network).</p>
  <p>So, implementation of CRAM-MD5 is an advanced task that should
  be attempted only when you are comfortable with, and fully
  understand how Courier-IMAP works in general. Here's an overview
  of this procedure:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Install and implement <code>@userdb@</code>, because
    CRAM-MD5 authentication uses the <code>@userdb@</code> database
    (but see below for LDAP-specific notes).</li>
    <li>Figure out which accounts are going to use CRAM-MD5
    authentication. People who do not use an IMAP client that
    supports CRAM-MD5 can continue and log in with the existing
    system password. But everyone who runs a client that supports
    CRAM-MD5 authentication will need a new password. Also, it will
    be necessary to set up CRAM-MD5 passwords for everyone at the
    same time. As soon as CRAM-MD5 authentication is enabled, all
    CRAM-MD5 enabled clients will attempt to use it. If no password
    is available, Courier-IMAP has no choice but to reject the
    authentication attempt. Once that happens, the client will
    correctly interpret it as an authentication failure (and it
    is), and the client will not even try to authenticate using the
    system password. Use the following command to assign a CRAM-MD5
    password:
      <pre>
userdbpw -hmac-md5 | userdb <i>userdb</i> set hmac-md5pw

</pre>Then run the <code>makeuserdb</code> command, as always.
    </li>
    <li>NOTE: CRAM-MD5 authentication is also be supported by
    <code>authldap</code>, <code>authpgsql</code> and
    <code>authmysql</code>, as long as clear-text passwords are
    used. See below for more information. Therefore, if you use
    LDAP, PostgreSQL, or MySQL, and you store clear-text passwords,
    you <i>should</i> all set and ready to go, and you do not need
    to install <code>/etc/userdb</code>, as described in this
    section.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Enabling CRAM-MD5 authentication</h3>
  <p>Because of these unfortunate complexities, CRAM-MD5
  authentication is disabled after installation. When you're ready
  to use CRAM-MD5, edit the <code>imapd</code> configuration file
  and add the "AUTH=CRAM-MD5" keyword to the IMAP_CAPABILITY
  environment variable, then restart Courier-IMAP. There are
  instructions in the <code>imapd</code> configuration file to that
  effect.</p>
  <p>If you do not intend to ever use CRAM-MD5 authentication, you
  can either specify <code>--without-authcram</code> option to the
  configure script, or simply edit <code>imapd</code> and remove
  authcram from the AUTHMODULES setting.</p>
  <h2><a name="sslcert" id="sslcert">CERTIFICATE
  AUTHENTICATION</a></h2>
  <p>Courier-IMAP can use SSL certificates for authentication
  purposes. For certificate authentication purposes, one of the
  fields in your certificates' subject must match the login ID in
  the authentication database. Consider the following
  certificate:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>
...
Subject: C=US,ST=New York,L=New York,O=Acme Widgets Inc,CN=John Smith,emailAddress=johnsmith@example.com
</pre>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If the <code>emailAddress</code> field is configured as the
  login ID, the authentication database must provide login details
  for <code>johnsmith@example.com</code>. To enable certificate
  authentication, edit the <code>imapd-ssl</code> and
  <code>pop3d-ssl</code> configuration files, and make the
  following changes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Set <code>TLS_TRUSTCERTS</code> to the filename with your
      certificate authority's X.509 certificate.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Change the <code>TLS_VERIFYPEER</code> setting to
      "<code>PEER</code>". The setting can also be changed to
      "<code>REQUIREPEER</code>" to require all SSL/TLS connections
      to provide a certificate. Otherwise, it is optional. If the
      mail client provides an SSL certificate, it may be used to
      authenticate. Without a certificate, password-based
      authentication remains an option.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Change the <code>TLS_EXTERNAL</code> setting to the name
      of the certificate subject field that gives the login ID. In
      the above example, this would be
      "<code>TLS_EXTERNAL=emailaddress</code>".</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>NOTE: GnuTLS's <code>certtool</code> uses
        "<code>email</code>" as the name of this field. If
        Courier-IMAP is compiled with GnuTLS, you should still
        specify this field as "<code>emailaddress</code>".</p>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2><a name="imapsend" id="imapsend">SENDING MAIL VIA AN IMAP
  CONNECTION</a></h2>
  <p>This server allows using the IMAP connection to send E-mail.
  Normally, the IMAP protocol provides only access to mail in an
  existing mail account, and mail clients must use SMTP in order to
  send mail. The Courier-IMAP server has an optional setting to
  enable mail to be send via an IMAP connection in a manner that
  should work with all existing IMAP mail clients. This can be
  useful when an account is logged in from a shared access pool
  which normally blocks most access to the SMTP port.</p>
  <p>This is implemented by enabling a setting in the
  <code>imapd</code> configuration file that designates a folder as
  a special "Outbox" folder. The default setting is a folder called
  "Outbox" (IMAP path INBOX.Outbox), but the name can be changed to
  anything. This folder, for the most part, is no different than
  any other folder. If a folder by that name doesn't exist, it
  needs to be created, just like any other IMAP folder. It looks
  and acts like any other folder, except that each message added to
  the folder, via IMAP's APPEND or COPY command, will also be
  mailed out by the Courier-IMAP server to the addresses listed in
  the <code>To:</code>, <code>Cc:</code>, and <code>Bcc:</code>
  headers.</p>
  <p>It should be possible to use this to send mail from any IMAP
  client by:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Composing a draft message, telling the IMAP client to save
    the draft message in its drafts folder on the IMAP server.</li>
    <li>Opening the drafts folder, and moving or copying the
    message to the Outbox folder.</li>
    <li>The act of copying the message into the Outbox folder will
    send the mail. There won't be any explicit notification to the
    fact that the message was sent, so it's a good idea to include
    your own E-mail address on the Cc: list.</li>
  </ol>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>NOTE:</b> it is tempting to configure the IMAP mail
    client to use Outbox as its default folder for saving drafts.
    Resist the temptation. If you forget, you'll save a partially
    completed draft, which will be then obediently mailed out.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>NOTE:</b> the message, in addition to being sent, will be
    saved in the folder in the normal fashion. After saving the
    message, reopen the Outbox folder and delete the sent message,
    or move it someplace else.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>NOTE:</b> when enabled, the Courier-IMAP server will
    advertize a private <code>XCOURIEROUTBOX</code> IMAP
    capability. It is theoretically possible to code an IMAP mail
    client that reads this capability and automatically configures
    itself accordingly -- when this IMAP capability is present --
    to send E-mail in the normal way but using the IMAP connection.
    At this time, I'm not aware of any actual mail clients that
    know how to do this.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>NOTE:</b> many mail clients save some additional internal
    information in headers of draft messages. The internal
    information is normally removed before the mail client sends
    the message. Make sure that none of this extra information is
    something that should not be mailed out.</p>

  will disable IMAP access for all accounts except those which have
  option <code>disableimap=0</code></p>

  <h2><a name="smap" id="smap">SMAP</a></h2>
  <p>Starting with Courier-IMAP 2.0, the server supports an

  Protocol". SMAP is an experiment to provide enhanced mail
  processing beyond what's currently possible with IMAP. SMAP's
  purpose is to prototype and develop advanced mail access
  functionality that's not possible with IMAP. SMAP is disabled by
  default. Uncomment the <code>SMAP_CAPABILITY</code> setting in
  the <code>imapd</code> configuration file in order to enable
  SMAP. The <a target="_blank" href=
