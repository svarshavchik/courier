  <para>The &ci; is a fast, scalable, enterprise &imap; server that
  uses Maildirs. Many E-mail service providers use the &ci; to
  easy handle hundreds of thousands of mail accounts. With its
  built-in &imap; and <acronym>POP3</acronym> aggregation proxy, the &ci; has practically
  infinite horizontal scalability. In a proxy configuration, a pool of
  Courier servers service initial &imap; and <acronym>POP3</acronym> connections from clients.
  They wait to receive the client's log in request, look up the server that
  actually holds this mail account's mailbox, and establish a proxy connection
  to the server, all in a single, seamless process.  Mail accounts can be
  moved between different servers, to achieve optimum resource usage.</para>

  <para>The only practical limitation on the &ci; is available network
  and I/O bandwidth. If you are new to the &ci;, this may sound a bit
  intimidating. But you do not need to tackle everything at once.  Start by
  taking small, easy steps. Your first step will be to set up a small
  the &ci; server, using it like any other traditional &imap; service, on a
  single server. After you gain experience and become comfortable with
  Courier, you can then begin exploring its advanced features.</para>

  <para>
This is the same &imap; server that's included in the
<ulink url="https://www.courier-mta.org/">Courier mail
  server</ulink>, but configured as a standalone &imap; server that can
  be used with other mail servers - such as Qmail, Exim, or Postfix
  - that deliver to maildirs. If you already have Courier installed,
you do not need
  to download this version. If you install this version, you must
  remove it if you later install the entire Courier server.</para>

    <para>
&imap; servers provide access to existing mail, in existing mailboxes.
&imap; servers are not involved in the mail delivery process.
You'll still need to have your mail server software receive mail via
SMTP and place it in recipients' mailboxes.</para>

    <para>
It does not matter to the &ci; which mail server you use: Sendmail, Postfix,
or something else, as long as the mail gets delivered to the correct
mailbox.
The &ci; just reads mail from existing mail accounts, without needing to know
how it gets there.</para>

    <para>
The &ci; uses "maildirs" to store its mail.
Please note that this &imap; server does NOT use traditional
mailbox files (<filename>/var/spool/mail</filename>, and derivatives), it was
written and optimized for the specific purpose of providing &imap;
access to Maildirs.
Consult your mail server's documentation for help on how to get it to
deliver mail in the "maildir" format.</para>

    <para>"Maildir" is a
<ulink url="https://www.courier-mta.org/maildir.html">directory-based mail
  storage format</ulink> originally introduced in the Qmail mail
  server, and adopted as an alternative mail storage format by both
  <ulink url="http://www.exim.org/">Exim</ulink> and
  <ulink url="http://www.postfix.org/">Postfix</ulink>.
  The &ci; is a popular combination with Qmail, Exim, and Postfix servers that are
  configured to use maildirs. The primary advantage of maildirs is
  that multiple applications can access the same Maildir
  simultaneously without requiring any kind of locking whatsoever.
  <ulink url="https://www.courier-mta.org/mbox-vs-maildir/">Maildir is a faster
  and more efficient way to store mail</ulink>. It works particularly
  well over NFS, which has a long history of locking-related
  woes.</para>

    <para>The &ci; implements several extensions to the basic
  Maildir mail storage format in order to support some additional
  features, such as folders and "soft" quotas. This is done in a
  way that's backwards compatible with the standard Maildir users
  (although, of course, they will ignore the additional features).
  Other software that understands and uses the same Maildir
  extensions is <ulink url="https://www.courier-mta.org/sqwebmail/">SqWebMail</ulink>, and
  <ulink url="https://www.courier-mta.org/maildrop/">maildrop</ulink>.</para>

Before downloading the &ci;, you MUST download and install
the <ulink url="https://www.courier-mta.org/authlib/">Courier
Authentication Library</ulink>.
This library is standalone module that maps login IDs and passwords to
their mailboxes.
Use the tools in the <filename>courier-authlib</filename> package to check
if the authentication library is working, recognizes the login passwords,
and displays the correct mailbox location.
Until you get the authentication library working first, you will not
be able to use the &ci;.</para>

    <title>&tutorial_setup_label;</title>

    <para>
This tutorial provides basic directions for troubleshooting the &ci; configuration.
This information should also work with other &imap;
servers, but the examples reflect output from the &ci;.</para>

    <para>
The starting point: the &ci; has just been installed, you start your favorite
&imap; mail reader, enter what you think is the correct server configuration,
and it does not work. Either your mail software hangs, shows nothing at all,
or complains with an error message.</para>

    <para>
There can be many possible reasons, but all of them can be reduced into
two categories: a problem with the &imap; server's configuration, or
a problem with the mail software's configuration. It may very well be that
the server is running properly, however the &imap; configuration in many
mail readers often has confusing configuration options, and the correct
settings may not be obvious.</para>

    <para>
This tutorial provides step-by-step directions for verifying the &ci;'s basic
operation. The following directions should establish whether the server is
running correctly, and if not, what the problem might be.</para>

    <section id="tutorial.setup.telnet">
      <title>Connecting to the &ci; server</title>

      <para>
The first step is to check if the &ci; is accepting connections. Open a terminal
window and type:</para>

      <blockquote>
	<informalexample>
	  <programlisting>telnet <replaceable>hostname</replaceable> 143
</programlisting>
	</informalexample>
      </blockquote>

      <para>
Replace <replaceable>hostname</replaceable> with the &imap; server's
<acronym>DNS</acronym> name. This expected results would look like this:</para>

      <blockquote>
	<informalexample>
	  <programlisting>$ telnet imap.example.com 143
Trying 10.0.0.12...
Connected to imap.example.com.

</programlisting>
	</informalexample>
      </blockquote>

      <para>
This shows that the &imap; server is running and accepting connections.
Your &imap; server may give a slightly difference response. If, on the other
hand, the connection fails:</para>

      <blockquote>
	<informalexample>
	  <programlisting>$ telnet imap.example.com 143
Trying 10.0.0.12...
telnet: connect to address 10.0.0.12: Connection refused
</programlisting>
	</informalexample>
      </blockquote>

      <para>
There are many reasons for a failed connection, but the two most common
are:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
The &imap; server is not running. Log on to the server and check if the
process is running:</para>
	  <blockquote>
	    <informalexample>
	      <programlisting># ps -ef | grep imap
root     30440 30439  0 Jul16 ?        00:00:00 /usr/lib/courier-imap/libexec/co
uriertcpd -address=0 -maxprocs=40 -maxperip=10 -nodnslookup -noidentlookup 143 /
usr/lib/courier-imap/sbin/imaplogin /usr/lib/courier-imap/bin/imapd Maildir
</programlisting>
	    </informalexample>
	  </blockquote>

	  <para>
Note that without active &imap; connections only the
<quote>couriertcpd</quote> process is running. Different &imap; servers will
use different process names. Another (and even better) way is to check if
anything is listening on port 143:</para>

	  <blockquote>
	    <informalexample>
	      <programlisting># /sbin/fuser -n tcp 143
143/tcp:             30440
</programlisting>
	    </informalexample>
	  </blockquote>

	  <para>
This indicates that process 30440 has port 143 open. This is a fairly
good indication that the &imap; server is running.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>
If the <application>telnet</application> connection fails, but the &imap;
server seems to be running, this is usually because of a firewall getting
in the way. Investigate any firewall settings on the &imap; server's host,
and any intervening network devices, and make any necessary adjustments
to open up port 143.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </section>

    <section id="tutorial.setup.login">
      <title>Logging in</title>

      <para>
Establishing a successful connection to the &imap; server does not eliminate
all potential sources of configuration errors. The next step is to
proceed and attempt to log in:</para>

      <blockquote>
	<informalexample>
	  <programlisting>$ telnet imap.example.com 143
Trying 10.0.0.12...
Connected to imap.example.com.

0 login testuser testpass
</programlisting>
	</informalexample>
      </blockquote>

      <para>
&imap; commands begin with an arbitrary label. This example uses the label
<quote>0</quote>.
Use the command <quote><command>0 login <replaceable>username</replaceable>
<replaceable>password</replaceable></command></quote>
to check if the &imap; server
can process a login request and open the mailbox. A succesful login looks
like this:</para>

      <blockquote>
	<informalexample>
	  <programlisting>...
0 login testuser testpass
0 OK LOGIN Ok.
</programlisting>
	</informalexample>
      </blockquote>

      <para>
Other &imap; servers may respond with a slightly different message after the
<quote><literal>OK</literal></quote>.
An error message should be self-evident:</para>

      <blockquote>
	<informalexample>
	  <programlisting>...
0 login testuser testpass
0 NO Login failed.
</programlisting>
	</informalexample>
      </blockquote>

      <para>
There are many reasons for a login failure message from the &ci;.
The most common reasons are:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
<application>courier-authlib</application> isn't running. Check that
its processes are running. The installation instructions for
<application>courier-authlib</application> contain directions for checking
that it's properly configured.
See <application>courier-authlib</application>'s <filename>INSTALL</filename>
file for more information.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>
The password is wrong, or the login ID does not exist.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>
The login account's entry specifies the login ID's home directory, and the
login ID's numeric system <replaceable>uid</replaceable> and
<replaceable>gid</replaceable>, but that information is incorrect or doesn't
match the login ID's actual home directory or
<replaceable>uid</replaceable>/<replaceable>gid</replaceable>.
It may not exist at all.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>
The actual error message should provide some indication as to what the
problem is. Also, look in syslog for any additional diagnostic information.
After making the necessary corrections, repeat the manual login process and
check that the login command succeeds.</para>

      <note>
	<para>
Some &imap; servers may be configured to accept encrypted connections only,
and all login commands will fail, unless they are encrypted.
If this is the case, no further progress can be made in troubleshooting
&imap; login problems, unless the &imap; server is temporarily reconfigured
to allow unencrypted logins.</para>
      </note>
    </section>

    <section id="tutorial.setup.inbox">
      <title>Opening the incoming mail folder</title>

      <para>
Other configuration problems may still exist even if the login
command succeeds. The next step is to try to open the incoming mail
folder:</para>

      <blockquote>
	<informalexample>
	  <programlisting>...
0 login testuser testpass
0 OK LOGIN Ok.
0 select inbox
* FLAGS (\Draft \Answered \Flagged \Deleted \Seen \Recent)
* OK [PERMANENTFLAGS (\* \Draft \Answered \Flagged \Deleted \Seen)] Limited
* 0 EXISTS

* OK [MYRIGHTS "acdilrsw"] ACL
0 OK [READ-WRITE] Ok
</programlisting>
	</informalexample>
      </blockquote>

      <para>
The command <quote>0 select inbox</quote> opens the incoming mail folder.
The above example shows a typical successful response from the &ci;.
The actual responses from different &imap; servers vary slight, the
above is a general example.
An obvious error message from the &ci; in response to this command indicates a
corrupt
mailbox. The most common reason is that the mailbox's system
<replaceable>uid</replaceable> and
<replaceable>gid</replaceable> is wrong and does not match the
login ID's record in <application>courier-authlib</application></para>
    </section>

    <section id="tutorial.setup.folders">
      <title>Obtaining a list of all mail folders</title>

      <para>
One last thing to check is to retrieve the list of existing &imap;
folders:</para>

      <blockquote>
	<informalexample>
	  <programlisting>...
0 LIST "" "*"
* LIST (\Unmarked \HasChildren) "." "INBOX"
* LIST (\HasChildren) "." "INBOX.Sent"
* LIST (\HasNoChildren) "." "INBOX.Drafts"
...
0 OK LIST completed
</programlisting>
	</informalexample>
      </blockquote>

      <para>
The command <quote><command>0 LIST "" "*"</command></quote> retrieves the
list of all folder names. The actual response to the command, of course,
varies with different servers.</para>

      <para>
The &ci; places virtual shared folders in a separate namespace.
This <command>LIST</command> command will not show virtual shared folders.
A slightly different command is required:</para>

      <blockquote>
	<informalexample>
	  <programlisting>...
0 LIST "" "#shared.*"
* LIST (\HasNoChildren) "." "#shared.postmaster.Calendar"
* LIST (\Noselect \HasChildren) "." "#shared.postmaster"
0 OK LIST completed
</programlisting>
	</informalexample>
      </blockquote>

      <para>
The command <quote><command>0 LIST "" "#shared.*"</command></quote> retrieves
the names of folders in the <quote><literal>#shared</literal></quote>
namespace. Use this command to check if virtual shared folders are properly
set up and which ones are visible to the login ID.
Setting up the &ci; virtual shared folders is a somewhat complicated process.
Running this command shows which virtual shared folders are accessible.
If no actual <quote><literal>#shared</literal></quote> folders appear in
response to this command, it means that no virtual shared folders are
accessible by this login ID.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="tutorial.setup.conclusion">
      <title>Conclusion</title>

      <para>
If the above commands produce the expected responses from the &imap; server,
that indicates that the &imap; server's major functions are properly working.
Any problems with &imap; mail reader is probably due to a configuration
issue with the mail reader, and the &imap; mail reader's forums or newsgroups
will probably be the best place to ask for assistance with properly configuring
the software.</para>

    <title>SMAP</title>

    <para>The &ci; optionally implements an
  experimental mail access protocol, dubbed "Simple Mail Access
  Protocol". SMAP is an experiment to provide enhanced mail
  processing beyond what's currently possible with &imap;.</para>

  <para>SMAP is <emphasis>disabled by default</emphasis>,
and must be explicitly
  enabled in the configuration file. SMAP's purpose is to prototype
  and develop advanced mail access functionality that's not
  possible with &imap;. Specifically:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><simpara>SMAP requires approximately 25% less bandwidth than &imap; to
    download large MIME attachments through low-bandwidth links.
    SMAP servers unwrap base64-encoded MIME attachments and send
    the raw, binary content to the client, eliminating the 25%
    base64 penalty. A similar optimization is also defined by an
    unofficial &imap; extension, but it is also a fairly new
    extension, and does not have wide client/server support.</simpara></listitem>

    <listitem><simpara>SMAP allows a single transaction to save a new message in
    the "Sent" folder, and mail it to its designated recipients.
    &imap; clients need to transmit the message a second time, using
    SMTP, requiring twice as much bandwidth and time as SMAP to do
    the same thing.</simpara></listitem>

    <listitem><simpara>SMAP folder names use the full UTF-8 character set; unlike
    &imap; no restrictions are placed on which characters may be
    included in folder names.</simpara></listitem>

    <listitem><simpara>SMAP implements both the "mark/expunge" paradigm as &imap;,
    and a simpler "delete" process.</simpara></listitem>

    <listitem><simpara>An SMAP client does not need to download the entire index
    of folder's contents when reopening a previously seen folder.
    When reopening a folder, the client receives a much shorter
    list of changes to the folder's contents since the last time
    the client had the folder opened. This is done by the client
    and server saving an index of folder's contents. After
    reopening the folder the server only needs to send a list of
    changes between the saved folder index, and the current folder
    index.</simpara></listitem>

    <listitem><simpara>Additional internationalization features are included in
    the design (but not yet used by the Courier
    implementation).</simpara></listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

    <para>SMAP is disabled by default. Uncomment the
  <literal>SMAP_CAPABILITY</literal> setting in the <filename>imapd</filename>
  configuration file in order to enable SMAP. The <ulink url="https://www.courier-mta.org/cone/index.html">Cone</ulink> mail client supports SMAP.</para>
