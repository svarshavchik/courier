Description: Standalone Courier mail filter package
 Maildrop is a combination mail filter/mail delivery agent.
 Maildrop reads the message to be delivered to your mailbox,
 optionally reads instructions from a file how filter incoming
 mail, then based on these instructions may deliver mail to an
 alternate mailbox, or forward it, instead of dropping the
 message into your mailbox.
 .
 Maildrop uses a structured, real, meta-programming language in
 order to define filtering instructions.  Its basic features are
 fast and efficient.  At sites which carry a light load, the
 more advanced, CPU-demanding, features can be used to build
 very sophisticated mail filters.  Maildrop deployments have
 been reported at sites that support as many as 30,000
 mailboxes.
