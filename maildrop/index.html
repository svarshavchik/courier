  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p><em>maildrop</em> is the mail filter/mail delivery agent
  that's used by the <a href="http://www.courier-mta.org" target=
  "_blank" shape="rect"><i>Courier</i> Mail Server</a>. You do not
  need to download <em>maildrop</em> from here if you already have
  the <i>Courier</i> mail server installed. This is a standalone
  build of the <em>maildrop</em> mail filter that can be used with
  other mail servers.</p>

  <p><em>maildrop</em> is a replacement for your local mail
  delivery agent. <em>maildrop</em> reads a mail message from
  standard input, then delivers the message to your mailbox.
  <em>maildrop</em> knows how to deliver mail to mbox-style
  mailboxes, and maildirs. "maildir" is a mailbox format used by
  the <i>Courier</i> mail server and <a href="http://www.qmail.org"
  target="_blank" shape="rect">Qmail</a>.</p>

  <p><em>maildrop</em> optionally reads instructions from a file,
  which describe how to filter incoming mail. These instructions
  can direct <em>maildrop</em> to deliver the message to an
  alternate mailbox, or forward it somewhere else. Unlike procmail,
  <em>maildrop</em> uses a structured filtering language.</p>

  <p><em>maildrop</em> is written in C++, and is significantly
  larger than procmail. However, it uses resources much more
  efficiently. Unlike procmail, <em>maildrop</em> will not read a
  10 megabyte mail message into memory. Large messages are saved in
  a temporary file, and are filtered from the temporary file. If
  the standard input to <em>maildrop</em> is a file, and not a
  pipe, a temporary file will not be necessary.</p>

  <p><em>maildrop</em> checks the mail delivery instruction syntax
  from the filter file, before attempting to deliver a message.
  Unlike procmail, if the filter file contains syntax errors,
  <em>maildrop</em> terminates without delivering the message. The
  user can fix the typo without causing any mail to be lost.</p>
