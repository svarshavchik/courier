# This script attempts to change a system account password in an automated
# fashion.  This implemention is an "expect" script for the passwd command.
#
# This script reads two lines of text from stdin: old password, new password
# then runs the passwd command to change the password, and we attempt to parse
# the output of passwd.
#
# This implementation is for the basic "passwd" command.  If it doesn't work
# for you, sorry: you're on your own.  Some common pitfalls:
#
# * Enhanced passwd implementations that reject passwords based on dictionary
# words, etc..  This can result in unexpected output from the passwd command
# that this script may not be able to handle.  We attempt to catch the most
# common error messages, below.  Finally, we use a 30 second timeout.
#
# * I dunno - there must be other problems with this.
