##NAME: LOCATION:0
#
# The SQLite database. You must create this database beforehand, and create
# the users table, as defined below.

SQLITE_DATABASE		/var/users.db

##NAME: SQLITE_USER_TABLE:0
#
# Suggested format of the table specified by SQLITE_USER_TABLE:
#
# CREATE TABLE passwd (
#        id                    text not null primary key,
#        crypt                 text,   # Either...
#        clear                 text,   # ... or
#        name                  text,
#        uid                   int,
#        gid                   int,
#        home                  text not null,
#        maildir               text,
#        defaultdelivery       text,
#        quota                 text,
#        options               text);
#
# Use either crypt or clear, to specify whether cleartext or crypted passwords
# get used (and define either SQLITE_CRYPT_PWFIELD or SQLITE_CLEAR_PWFIELD,
# below, accordingly).

SQLITE_USER_TABLE	passwd

##NAME: SQLITE_CRYPT_PWFIELD:0
#
# Either SQLITE_CRYPT_PWFIELD or SQLITE_CLEAR_PWFIELD must be defined.  Both
# are OK too. crypted passwords go into SQLITE_CRYPT_PWFIELD, cleartext
# passwords go into SQLITE_CLEAR_PWFIELD.  Cleartext passwords allow
# CRAM-MD5 authentication to be implemented.

SQLITE_CRYPT_PWFIELD	crypt

##NAME: SQLITE_CLEAR_PWFIELD:0
#
#
# SQLITE_CLEAR_PWFIELD	clear

##NAME: SQLITE_DEFAULT_DOMAIN:0
#
# If DEFAULT_DOMAIN is defined, and someone tries to log in as 'user',
# we will search for 'user@DEFAULT_DOMAIN' instead.
#
#
# DEFAULT_DOMAIN		example.com

##NAME: SQLITE_UID_FIELD:0
#
# Other fields in the sqlite table:
#
# SQLITE_UID_FIELD - contains the numerical userid of the account
#
SQLITE_UID_FIELD		uid

##NAME: SQLITE_GID_FIELD:0
#
# Numerical groupid of the account

SQLITE_GID_FIELD		gid

##NAME: SQLITE_LOGIN_FIELD:0
#
# The login id, default is id.  Basically the query is:
#
#  SELECT SQLITE_UID_FIELD, SQLITE_GID_FIELD, ... WHERE id='loginid'
#

SQLITE_LOGIN_FIELD	id

##NAME: SQLITE_HOME_FIELD:0
#

SQLITE_HOME_FIELD	home

##NAME: SQLITE_NAME_FIELD:0
#
# The user's name (optional)

SQLITE_NAME_FIELD	name

##NAME: SQLITE_MAILDIR_FIELD:0
#
# This is an optional field, and can be used to specify an arbitrary
# location of the maildir for the account, which normally defaults to
# $HOME/Maildir (where $HOME is read from SQLITE_HOME_FIELD).
#
# You still need to provide a SQLITE_HOME_FIELD, even if you uncomment this
# out.
#
# SQLITE_MAILDIR_FIELD	maildir

##NAME: SQLITE_DEFAULTDELIVERY:0
#
# Courier mail server only: optional field specifies custom mail delivery
# instructions for this account (if defined) -- essentially overrides
# DEFAULTDELIVERY from ${sysconfdir}/courierd
#
# SQLITE_DEFAULTDELIVERY defaultdelivery

##NAME: SQLITE_QUOTA_FIELD:0
#
# Define SQLITE_QUOTA_FIELD to be the name of the field that can optionally
# specify a maildir quota.  See README.maildirquota for more information 
#
# SQLITE_QUOTA_FIELD	quota

##NAME: SQLITE_AUXOPTIONS:0
#
# Auxiliary options.  The SQLITE_AUXOPTIONS field should be a char field that
# contains a single string consisting of comma-separated "ATTRIBUTE=NAME"
# pairs.  These names are additional attributes that define various per-account
# "options", as given in INSTALL's description of the "Account OPTIONS"
# setting.
#
# SQLITE_AUXOPTIONS_FIELD	options
#
# You might want to try something like this, if you'd like to use a bunch
# of individual fields, instead of a single text blob:
#
# SQLITE_AUXOPTIONS_FIELD	"disableimap=" || disableimap || ",disablepop3=" || disablepop3 || ",disablewebmail=" || disablewebmail || ",sharedgroup=" || sharedgroup
#
# This will let you define fields called "disableimap", etc, with the end result
# being something that the OPTIONS parser understands.


##NAME: SQLITE_WHERE_CLAUSE:0
#
# This is optional, SQLITE_WHERE_CLAUSE can be basically set to an arbitrary
# fixed string that is appended to the WHERE clause of our query
#
# SQLITE_WHERE_CLAUSE	server='mailhost.example.com'

##NAME: SQLITE_SELECT_CLAUSE:0
#
# This is optional, SQLITE_SELECT_CLAUSE can be set when you have a database,
# which is structuraly different from the proposed layout. The fixed string will
# be used to do a SELECT operation on database, which should return fields
# in order specified bellow:
#
# username, cryptpw, clearpw, uid, gid, home, maildir, quota, fullname, options
#
# The username field should include the domain (see example below).
#
# Enabling this option causes ignorance of any other field-related
# options, excluding default domain.
#
# There are two variables, which you can use. Substitution will be made
# for them, so you can put entered username (local part) and domain name
# in the right place of your query. These variables are:
#	 	$(local_part), $(domain), $(service)
#
# If a $(domain) is empty (not given by the remote user) the default domain
# name is used in its place.
#
# $(service) will expand out to the service being authenticated: imap, imaps,
# pop3 or pop3s.  Courier mail server only: service will also expand out to
# "courier", when searching for local mail account's location.  In this case,
# if the "maildir" field is not empty it will be used in place of
# DEFAULTDELIVERY.  Courier mail server will also use esmtp when doing
# authenticated ESMTP.
#
# For example:
#
# SQLITE_SELECT_CLAUSE	SELECT popbox.local_part || '@' || popbox.domain_name,\
#			'{MD5}' || popbox.password_hash),		\
#			popbox.clearpw,					\
#			domain.uid,					\
#			domain.gid,					\
#			domain.path || '/' || popbox.mbox_name, 	\
#			'',						\
#			domain.quota,					\
#			'',						\
#			"disableimap=" || disableimap || ",disablepop3=" || \
#                       disablepop3 || ",disablewebmail=" || disablewebmail || \
#                              ",sharedgroup=" || sharedgroup           \
#			FROM popbox, domain				\
#			WHERE popbox.local_part = '$(local_part)'	\
#			AND popbox.domain_name = '$(domain)'		\
#			AND popbox.domain_name = domain.domain_name


##NAME: SQLITE_ENUMERATE_CLAUSE:1
#
# Optional custom SQL query used to enumerate accounts for authenumerate,
# in order to compile a list of accounts for shared folders.  The query
# should return the following fields: name, uid, gid, homedir, maildir, options
#
# Example:
# SQLITE_ENUMERATE_CLAUSE SELECT popbox.local_part || '@' || popbox.domain_name, \
#			domain.uid,					\
#			domain.gid,					\
#			domain.path || '/' || popbox.mbox_name, 	\
#			'',						\
#			'sharedgroup=' || sharedgroup 			\
#			FROM popbox, domain				\
#			WHERE popbox.local_part = '$(local_part)'	\
#			AND popbox.domain_name = '$(domain)'		\
#			AND popbox.domain_name = domain.domain_name


##NAME: SQLITE_CHPASS_CLAUSE:0
#
# This is optional, SQLITE_CHPASS_CLAUSE can be set when you have a database,
# which is structuraly different from proposed. The fixed string will
# be used to do an UPDATE operation on database. In other words, it is
# used, when changing passwords. This is used by sqwebmail/Courier webmail.
#
# There are four variables, which you can use. Substitution will be made
# for them, so you can put entered username (local part) and domain name
# in the right place of your query. There variables are:
# 	$(local_part) , $(domain) , $(newpass) , $(newpass_crypt)
#
# If a $(domain) is empty (not given by the remote user) the default domain
# name is used in its place.
# $(newpass) contains plain password
# $(newpass_crypt) contains its crypted form
#
# SQLITE_CHPASS_CLAUSE	UPDATE	popbox					\
#			SET	clearpw='$(newpass)',			\
#				password_hash='$(newpass_crypt)'	\
#			WHERE	local_part='$(local_part)'		\
#			AND	domain_name='$(domain)'
#
