  <h2><a name="Requirements" id=
  "Requirements">Requirements</a></h2>

  <p>See the README file for a general description of this library.
  The following software should be installed before building the
  Courier authentication library:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The current version of gcc (<a onclick="" href=
    "http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/">http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/</a>)</li>

    <li>The GNU linker (<a onclick="" href=
    "http://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/">http://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/</a>)</li>

    <li>Libtool (<a onclick="" href=
    "http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/">http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/</a>).
    Additional, libtool's <tt>libltdl</tt> library, and its
    development files, must be installed. On some platforms this is
    a separate package. On Fedora, this is the
    <tt>libtool-ltdl-devel</tt> package, for example.</li>

    <li>GNU make (<a onclick="" href=
    "http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">http://www.gnu.org/software/make/</a>)</li>

    <li>The "<code>expect</code>" command. <code>expect</code> is
    usually included with most systems. <code>Expect</code> can be
    downloaded from <code>http://expect.nist.gov/</code> if it's
    not installed on your system. This utility is used to change
    system login passwords, by scripting the <code>passwd</code>
    command. If you do not have <code>expect</code> installed you
    will not be able to change system login passwords. However
    non-system authentication modules (LDAP, PostgreSQL, and
    others) will work.</li>

    <li>Courier Unicode Library. Before installing
    this package, download and install <a onclick="" href=
    "http://www.courier-mta.org/unicode/">http://www.courier-mta.org/unicode/</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Courier-authlib uses Libtool to build shared libraries.
  Libtool must be installed, together with its <tt>libltdl</tt>
  library and its header files.</p>

  <p>On non-Linux platforms the GNU linker is also required.
  Courier-authlib's build script uses some GNU linker-specific
  options. It's possible to manually specify the native linker's
  equivalent options manually, if they exist. If the native linker
  does not have the equivalent options, the GNU linker will have to
  be installed.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, GNU make will be required in almost every
  case. SYSV-derived make variants (probably) will not work.</p>

  <p>The same line of logic also applies to gcc. So, strictly
  speaking, only a basic C compiler, GNU make and libtool, are
  really needed to build courier-authlib. Still, try the following
  before giving up if problems occur when building this
  package:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Install a recent version of the GNU linker</li>

    <li>Install the current version of Libtool</li>

    <li>Install the current version of gcc</li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="Installation" id="Installation">Installation
  overview</a></h2>

  <p>
    Courier-authlib should be built into a native installable package for
    your distribution (rpm for Fedora and derives, deb for Debian and its
    derivatives, etc..). The following documentation is for documentation
    purposes. See "Guidelines", below, for packaging instructions.
  </p>

  <p>The following sequence of commands should be sufficient to
  install courier-authlib in most cases:</p>
  <pre>
./configure [options] [variable=value]*...
make
make install
make install-configure
</pre>

  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> On the BSD family, GNU make is
    usually the 'gmake' command. Use the 'gmake' command, instead
    of 'make'.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The '<code>make install-configure</code>' command is required;
  it installs and updates the configuration files; this command
  must be executed when installing Courier-authlib for the first
  time, and when upgrading from an older version.</p>

  <h3>Configuration options</h3>

  <p>The configure script takes the usual <code>autoconf</code>
  options: <code>--prefix</code>, <code>--bindir</code>, and the
  rest of the usual toolchain options. The default installation
  directories should be sufficient, though.</p>

  <p><strong>DO NOT USE</strong> the <code>--disable-static</code>,
  or <code>--enable-static=no</code> option. Both static and shared
  library options must be enabled for courier-authlib to build
  properly (but see "Post-installation cleanup" below).</p>

  <h4><code>--without-stdheaderdir</code></h4>

  <p>The default configuration installs development files in
  <code>/usr/local/include</code> (see "What gets installed",
  below). This directory is usually in the compiler's search path
  for header files. This option must be specified if the compiler
  does NOT search for header files in
  <code>/usr/local/include</code> by default.</p>

  <p>This option must also be specified if other configuration
  options (such as <code>--prefix</code> or
  <code>--includedir</code>) specify a different installation
  directory, and the new directory is also not searched by the
  compiler, by default</p>

  <h4><code>--with-mailuser=<em>userid</em>,
  --with-mailgroup=<em>groupid</em></code></h4>

  <p>"userid" is a reserved system username, "groupid" is a
  reserved system groupname. These two options should be used
  before installing Courier for the first time. These options are
  not required before installing Courier-IMAP or SqWebMail.</p>

  <p>These options specify the user/group that will own the
  configuration files, and the socket that authentication daemon
  process listens on. This is a key part of Courier's security
  model.</p>

  <p>These options should not be necessary if upgrading from an
  earlier version of Courier and/or this authentication library.
  The default userid and groupid are computed as follows:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If an earlier version of the Courier authentication library
    is already installed in the same directory, the userid and the
    groupid is the same as the earlier version, otherwise:</li>

    <li>If an earlier version of the Courier package is installed
    (only the Courier package, the Courier-IMAP and SqWebMail
    packages do not carry this information), the userid and the
    groupid is the same as the ones used to configure Courier,
    otherwise:</li>

    <li>The userid is the first userid from the following list
    which exists in the system: courier, daemon, adm, bin, root;
    and the groupid is the first groupid from the following list
    which exists in the system: courier, daemon, adm, sys,
    root.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>When installing Courier authentication library for the first
  time, it is highly recommended to create a "courier" userid and
  groupid, so that specifying these options will not be
  necessary.</p>

  <p>This configure script descends from the old authentication
  library that was included in the older Courier, Courier-IMAP, and
  SqWebMail packages. As such, it also has many other undocumented
  options that manually disable specific authentication
  modules.</p>

  <p><strong>These options are no longer officially
  documented.</strong> Individual modules can be disabled after
  installation, by editing the <code>authdaemonrc</code>
  configuration file.</p>

  <h4><code>VARIABLE=</code><em><code>value</code></em></h4>

  <p>Environment variables may be set either before running the
  configure script, or by providing the environment variables as
  parameters to the configure script. Example:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>
./configure --with-mailuser=mail --with-mailgroup=mail \
     CC=/opt/fsf/bin/gcc LDFLAGS=-L/opt/fsf/lib \
     MAKE=gmake
</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The <code>CC</code> environment variable specifies the name of
  the C compiler that will be used to compile the authentication
  library. For some reason, on this oddball system some system
  libraries are installed in <code>/opt/fsf/lib</code>, and the
  compiler doesn't search this directory by default. Therefore, the
  compiler needs the "<code>-L/opt/fsf/lib</code>" to properly link
  all programs, and this option is specified in the
  <code>LDFLAGS</code> environment variable.</p>

  <p>Another possibility is to add the <code>/opt/fsf/bin</code>
  directory to the <code>PATH</code> environment variable, prior to
  running the <code>configure</code> script. The
  <code>configure</code> script searches for all needed software in
  the current <code>PATH</code>. Explicitly pointing configure to
  something, like <code>CC</code>, is only needed if the program is
  not already in the default PATH.</p>

  <p>Finally, Courier authentication library must be built with GNU
  make. On this example system the <code>make</code> command is the
  old SysV-derived make, which will not work. GNU make is installed
  here as the "<code>gmake</code>" command. The
  <code>configure</code> script will ordinarily find the
  <code>make</code> command and be happy with it, by mistake.
  Explicitly setting <code>MAKE</code> to <code>gmake</code> fixes
  that (and the human operator also needs to invoke the
  <code>gmake</code> command also).</p>

  <h2><a name="deps" id="Dependencies">Dependencies</a></h2>

  <p>On a minimum, bare-bones system, the Courier authentication
  library builds support for garden-variety authentication against
  system accounts (from the system's password file,
  <code>/etc/passwd</code>).</p>

  <p>If the <code>configure</code> script detects that certain
  optional software components are installed, additional
  authentication modules will be built and installed. This chapter
  describes what needs to be installed in order to build the
  optional authentication modules.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> In all cases, it is not sufficient to
    install the runtime support libraries for the following
    components. In order to build the authentication modules the
    <strong>DEVELOPMENT LIBRARIES</strong> for the following
    software packages must be installed. The development libraries
    are usually a separate package, that must be installed in
    addition to the package that adds alleged support for the
    following software libraries.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>GDBM or Berkeley DB library</strong> - The
    <code>userdb</code> authentication module will be built if
    either library is installed. The <code>userdb</code>
    authentication module includes Perl scripts that maintain a
    list of available accounts in plain text files. A Perl script
    then compiles the account list into a binary database, either
    GDBM or DB, which is then used to look up account
    information.</li>

    <li><strong>OpenLDAP</strong> - The LDAP authentication modules
    requires OpenLDAP client libraries to be installed. Sometimes
    there's some confusion when commercial LDAP servers are used,
    which come with their own development toolkits, which use a
    different API than OpenLDAP. Even if a commercial LDAP server
    is used to provide LDAP services, OpenLDAP is still required to
    enable LDAP services in Courier.</li>

    <li><strong>MySQL</strong>, <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, and
    <strong>SQLite</strong> - The MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite
    authentication modules require, obviously,
    MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQLite development libraries.<br /></li>
  </ul>

  <h2><a name="What" id="What">What gets installed</a></h2>

  <ul>
    <li><code>/usr/local/etc/authlib</code> - the configuration
    files.</li>

    <li><code>/usr/local/sbin</code> - the authdaemond startup
    script; several utility programs (courierlogger, authconfig,
    authtest, authenumerate); and userdb scripts.</li>

    <li><code>/usr/local/lib/courier-authlib</code> - various
    authentication modules, as shared libraries.</li>

    <li><code>/usr/local/libexec/courier-authlib</code> - some
    miscellaneous stuff.</li>

    <li><code>/usr/local/var/authdaemon</code> - a subdirectory
    that contains the filesystem socket which authdaemond listens
    on.</li>

    <li><code>/usr/local/include</code> - a header file that
    Courier packages will use to build against
    courier-authlib.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Toolchain options to the <code>configure</code> script may be
  used to select alternative installation directories for these
  components.</p>

  <h3>Post-installation cleanup</h3>

  <p>On most systems, after running <code>make
  install-configure</code> all static libraries can be removed from
  the <code>/usr/local/lib/courier-authlib</code> directory:</p>

  <p><code>rm -rf /usr/local/lib/courier-authlib/*.a</code></p>

  <p>The Courier authentication library uses only the shared
  libraries. The static versions of the shared libraries are not
  used. They are installed by default, via libtool, but are not
  really needed. On most platforms the libtool files, "*.la" can
  also be removed. Do not remove any soft links.</p>

  <h2><a name="manpage" id="manpage">For more information</a></h2>

  <p>Following "<code>make install</code>", see the <a href=
  "README_authlib.html"><code>README_authlib.html</code></a> file
  for details on setting up the authentication modules. The
  <code>README_authlib.html</code> file gets assembled as part of
  the build process.</p>

  <p>Before proceding to install any other packages, be sure to
  verify that the authentication library is working by running the
  <code>authtest</code> command, as documented in the
  <code>README_authlib.html</code> file.</p>

  <h2><a name="Starting" id="Starting">Starting and stopping the
  authentication daemon</a></h2>

  <p>The following command must be added to your system startup
  script, in order to initialize the authentication library when
  booting:</p>
  <pre>
/usr/local/sbin/authdaemond start
</pre>

  <p>Similarly, the authentication library can be stopped by the
  "<code>authdaemond stop</code>" command. After editing the
  <code>authdaemonrc</code> configuration file use
  "<code>authdaemond restart</code>" command to reconfigure the
  daemon process. Systems that use SYSV-derived initscripts can use
  the "<code>courier-authlib.sysvinit</code>" script, which gets
  built in the source directory, to start and stop
  <code>authdaemond</code> when the system boots or halts.</p>

  <h2><a name="Building" id="Building">Building RPMs</a></h2>

  <p>See <a onclick=
  ""><code>http://www.courier-mta.org/FAQ.html#rpm</code></a> for
  instructions on building binary RPMs from the source tarball.
  Those instructions will work for this package.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong></p>

    <p>RPM will refuse to build the Courier authentication library
    unless all prerequisite development libraries for LDAP, MySQL,
    PostgreSQL, and SQLite are installed. <strong>Do not try to
    hack the RPM build script to ignore these
    dependencies!</strong> For simplicity's and maintainability
    sake the RPM build script creates all available authentication
    modules. All extra authentication modules will be built as
    <em>optional</em> subpackages. They do not have to be installed
    at runtime. Install the LDAP, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite
    development libraries only for the duration of building binary
    RPMs. They can be uninstalled afterwards.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2><a name="Guidelines" id="Guidelines">Guidelines for using
  other package managers</a></h2>

  <p>The recommended way to build packages can be inferred from the
  RPM build script. It is summarized here for convenience:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Decide whether or not Courier-specific userid and groupid
    needs to be created, and, if so, make the necessary
    arrangements.</li>

    <li>Ensure that all prerequisite development libraries are
    available.</li>

    <li>Run the <code>configure</code> script, run
    <code>make</code>, then <code>make install</code> as
    usual.</li>

    <li>Copy the "<code>sysconftool</code>" script somewhere into
    the installation tree. A good place would be
    <code>%libexecdir%/courier-authlib</code>. This is the
    '<code>make install-upgrade</code>' command. Don't run this at
    build time. Instead, arrange for the package installation
    script to run the "<code>sysconftool
    %sysconfdir%/authlib/*.dist</code>" after the package is
    installed <strong>OR UPGRADED</strong>.</li>

    <li>The "<code>authdaemond</code>",
    "<code>authenumerate</code>", and "<code>authtest</code>"
    commands can be renamed, to avoid name clashes.</li>

    <li>There are two types of libraries that get installed in
      <code>%libdir%</code>:

      <ol>
	<li>Common libraries that application link with,
	  <code>libcourier*</code>.</li>
	<li>Dynamically-loaded authentication modules:
	  <code>libauth*</code>.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Remove all static libraries from
	<code>%libdir%/courier-authlib</code>.
	Keep the <code>*.la</code> and <code>*.so</code> for
	<code>libcourier*</code>, and include them
	in a devel subpackage.
	Remove <code>*.la</code> and <code>*.so</code> for
	all <code>libauth*</code> libraries, they are not needed.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Now, create the installable packages, as follows:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>%libdir%/courier-authlib/libauthldap*</code> goes
    into the LDAP subpackage.</li>

    <li><code>%libdir%/courier-authlib/libauthmysql*</code> goes
    into the MySQL subpackage.</li>

    <li><code>%libdir%/courier-authlib/libauthsqlite*</code> goes
    into the SQLite subpackage.</li>

    <li><code>%libdir%/courier-authlib/libauthpgsql*</code> goes
    into the PostgreSQL subpackage.</li>

    <li><code>%libdir%/courier-authlib/libauthuserdb*</code> goes
    into the userdb subpackage.</li>

    <li>Everything else can go into the main package. Optionally,
    the <code>courierauthconfig</code> binary, stuff in
    <code>%includedir%</code>, and in <code>%mandir%/man3</code>,
    can go into a devel subpackage.</li>
  </ul>
</body>
</html>
