  <h1>Download SqWebMail</h1>

  <h2>Requirements</h2>

  <p>SqWebMail requires that either the GDBM or the DB library must
  be installed. Perl is also required. GNU make and gcc/egcs is
  also highly recommended. There have been intermittent reports of
  various problems with using other make utilities, or other
  compilers. Chances are that everything will compile and install
  properly, though. Currently, some of the component libraries
  include some self-test code written in C++. SqWebMail itself is
  written entirely in C, and the C++ components are not used;
  however you have to be able to compile C++, for now.</p>

  <p>Read <tt>INSTALL</tt>, <tt>SECURITY</tt> and <tt>BUGS</tt>
  before compiling and installing SqWebMail. Loading
  <tt>http://yourwebsite/cgi-bin/sqwebmail</tt> shows the login
  page. You can manually move <tt>sqwebmail</tt> to any other
  directory, and use any URL that resolves to
  <tt>sqwebmail</tt>.</p>
