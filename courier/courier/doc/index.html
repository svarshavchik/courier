  <p>The <em>Courier</em> mail transfer agent (MTA) is an
  integrated mail/groupware server based on open commodity
  protocols, such as ESMTP, IMAP, POP3, LDAP, SSL, and HTTP.
  <em>Courier</em> provides ESMTP, IMAP, POP3, webmail, and mailing
  list services within a single, consistent, framework. Individual
  components can be enabled or disabled at will. The
  <em>Courier</em> mail server now implements basic web-based
  calendaring and scheduling services integrated in the webmail
  module. Advanced groupware calendaring services will follow
  soon.</p>

  <p>The <em>Courier</em> mail server's source code should compile
  on most POSIX-based operating systems based on Linux, and
  BSD-derived kernels. The <em>Courier</em> mail server should also
  compile on Solaris and AIX, with some help from Sun's or IBM's
  freeware add-on tools for their respective operating systems.</p>

  <p>The <em>Courier</em> mail server evolved out of several
  related projects, that merged together (more on that later). The
  <em>Courier</em> mail server implements SMTP extensions for
  mailing list management and spam filtering. The <em>Courier</em>
  mail server can function as an intermediate mail relay, relaying
  mail between an internal LAN and the Internet, or perform final
  delivery to mailboxes. The <em>Courier</em> mail server uses
  <a target="_blank" href=
  "http://www.courier-mta.org/mbox-vs-maildir/" shape=
  "rect">maildirs</a> as its native mail storage format, but it can
  also deliver mail to legacy mailbox files as well. The
  <em>Courier</em> mail server's configuration is set by plain text
  files and Perl scripts. Most of The <em>Courier</em> mail
  server's configuration can now be adjusted from a web browser,
  using The <em>Courier</em> mail server's web-based administration
  module.</p>

  <p>The <em>Courier</em> mail server can provide mail services for
  regular operating system accounts. The <em>Courier</em> mail
  server can also provide mail services for virtual mail accounts,
  managed by an LDAP, MySQL, or PostgreSQL-based authentication
  database.</p>

  <p>Certain portions of the <em>Courier</em> mail server -
  <a target="_top" href="http://www.courier-mta.org/maildrop/"
  shape="rect">the mail filtering engine</a>, the <a href=
  "http://www.courier-mta.org/sqwebmail/" target="_top" shape=
  "rect">webmail server</a> and the <a target="_top" href=
  "http://www.courier-mta.org/imap/" shape="rect">IMAP server</a> -
  are also available as separate, smaller, packages that can be
  used with other mail servers.</p>

  <h2><a name="features" id="features"></a>Features</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Can be configured to function as an intermediate mail
    relay, or as a mail server that receives mail for multiple
    domains and makes it accessible to mail clients, or anything in
    between.</li>

    <li>On servers with multiple IP addresses, optionally assign a
    <a href="courier.html#multihomed">vanity configuration to
    <em>Courier</em> for each IP address</a>, making each IP
    address look like a separate, dedicated, mail server instance,
    for both incoming and outgoing mail. An alternative limited
    vanity configuration for outgoing mail only, based on the
    sending mail client's authenticated login, is possible when
    multiple IP addresses are not available.</li>

    <li>Web-based administration and configuration tool.</li>

    <li>Local mailboxes can be accessed via POP3. The
    <em>Courier</em> mail server includes an integrated POP3
    server.</li>

    <li>Local mailboxes can be accessed via IMAP. The
    <em>Courier</em> mail server includes an integrated IMAP
    server.</li>

    <li>A built-in IMAP/POP3 aggregator proxy. It is possible to
    distribute all mailboxes between multiple servers. A separate
    server (or a pool of servers) accepts connections from IMAP or
    POP3 clients, then connects to the right server based on the
    mailbox the connecting client is logging into.</li>

    <li>Local mailboxes can be accessed via HTTP. The
    <em>Courier</em> mail server includes an <a href=
    "/sqwebmail/screenshots.html">integrated webmail
    server</a>.</li>

    <li>The webmail server includes a personal <a target="_blank"
    href=
    "http://www.courier-mta.org/sqwebmail/images/monthly.png">event
    calendar</a>.</li>

    <li>Uses an efficient <a target="_blank" href=
    "http://www.courier-mta.org/mbox-vs-maildir/">maildir</a>
    format as its native mail storage format. Some support is
    provided for legacy mbox mailboxes.</li>

    <li>Flexible "Sender Policy Framework" support; the ESMTP
    <code>HELO</code>, <code>MAIL FROM</code>, and the
    <code>From:</code> header can be validated using SPF.</li>

    <li>DSN, PIPELINING, and 8BITMIME ESMTP extensions. The
    <em>Courier</em> mail server automatically converts 8-bit
    messages to 7-bit encoding, for relaying mail to external mail
    gateways.</li>

    <li>STARTTLS ESMTP extension (as well as
    IMAP/POP3/ESMTP/Webmail over SSL) in both the client and the
    server (requires OpenSSL). The ESMTP client can optionally
    require that the remote server's X.509 certificate is signed by
    a trusted root CA (a default set of root CAs is provided).</li>

    <li>Experimental TLS/SSL enhancements which are designed to
    implement a secure mail delivery channel between trusted
    domains, over an untrusted network. This is implemented by
    requiring mail to select domains use TLS/SSL connections which
    require the remote server to present an X.509 certificate
    signed by a private (not a public) certificate authority. This
    is pretty much the highest level of security that can be
    achieved with today's technologies. This doesn't even require
    DNSsec. Even if the DNS cache is poisoned with MX records that
    divert mail to a rogue relay, the attacker will not have an
    X.509 certificate signed by a private CA (this assumes, of
    course, that the security of the private CA hasn't been
    breached). This work is mostly complete, but still needs a
    little testing.</li>

    <li>Message submission protocol (RFC 2476).</li>

    <li>IPv6 support (experimental).</li>

    <li>NOTE: the integrated servers work with maildir-based
    mailboxes only. There are many existing POP3, IMAP, and webmail
    servers that provide excellent support for mbox-based
    mailboxes, so there's no reason to reinvent the wheel. Some
    popular mbox servers are: <a target="_blank" href=
    "http://www.eudora.com/qpopper/">Qpopper</a>, <a target=
    "_blank" href="http://www.washington.edu/imap/">UW-IMAP</a>,
    and <a target="_blank" href=
    "http://neomail.sourceforge.net/">NeoMail</a>.</li>

    <li>A faxmail gateway (experimental) that forwards E-mail
    messages via fax (requires a compatible class 2 faxmodem). The
    <em>Courier</em> mail server doesn't implement the actual
    faxing all by itself, actually. The <em>Courier</em> mail
    server uses additional software (which must be separately
    installed), to take care of the low-level details. The popular
    <a target="_blank" href=
    "http://alpha.greenie.net/mgetty/">mgetty+sendfax</a> package
    talks to the faxmodem and handles the actual faxing. Conversion
    of E-mail messages to fax pages is done by <a target="_blank"
    href="http://www.ghostscript.com/">ghostscript</a>, troff or
    <a target="_blank" href=
    "http://www.gnu.org/software/groff/groff.html">groff</a>, and
    the <a target="_blank" href=
    "http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/">NetPBM</a> library. The
    <em>Courier</em> mail server glues all of these pieces together
    in a seamless manner any time an E-mail message addressed to
    <code>&lt;phonenumber@fax&gt;</code> is received. The main
    textual body of the E-mail message is placed on a cover page,
    and any attachments are converted to fax image format and
    transmitted after the cover page. At this time, The
    <em>Courier</em> mail server knows how to send plain text, PDF,
    and Postscript attachments. GIF, JPEG, and PNG images can be
    sent to (one image per page). The additional software packages
    that were mentioned previously are usually already included in
    most Linux and BSD installations. In most cases no additional
    software really needs to be installed in order to get
    faxmailing up and running.</li>

    <li>The <em>Courier</em> mail server includes a mailing list
    manager, with fully automatic bounce processing.</li>

    <li>You don't need a full-blown mail server? <em>Courier</em>
    mail server's <a target="_top" href=
    "http://www.courier-mta.org/imap/">IMAP server</a>, <a target=
    "_top" href="http://www.courier-mta.org/sqwebmail/">webmail
    server</a>, and <a target="_top" href=
    "http://www.courier-mta.org/maildrop/">mail filter</a> are
    available as independent packages that can be used with other
    mail servers (as long as the other mail servers store mail in
    <a target="_blank" href=
    "http://www.qmail.org/man/man5/maildir.html">maildirs</a>).
    These sub-packages are assembled from the same source code
    tree. The only difference is the top level makefile. Note: the
    independent builds are not always in sync with the main the
    <em>Courier</em> mail server build at any given time. They
    follow their own schedule, and may include a slightly older, or
    even more recent, code base! Over time, however, everything
    always syncs together since all builds are assembled from the
    same source code repository.</li>

    <li>SOCKSv5 support. The <em>Courier</em> mail server can punch
    through a SOCKS firewall to send outgoing mail. Receiving mail
    through a SOCKS firewall is not yet supported. To use SOCKS you
    need to install the <em>Courier</em> mail server's Socks 5
    proxy client library.</li>

    <li>PAM, LDAP, PostgreSQL (beta), or MySQL authentication. LDAP
    authentication requires <a target="_blank" href=
    "http://www.openldap.org">OpenLDAP</a> to be installed.
    LDAP-based mail routing is also supported.</li>

    <li>Gateway mail to/from UUCP (if compatible UUCP software is
    separately installed).</li>

    <li>Authenticated SMTP.</li>

    <li><code>XVERP</code> and <code>XEXDATA</code> ESMTP
    extensions.</li>

    <li>DNS-based blacklists. Ability to exempt whitelisted IP
    addresses from the blacklists.</li>

    <li>Integrated mail filtering. An API is provided for
    installing arbitrary external mail filters, and the system
    administrator can selectively enable for any mail source
    (ESMTP, UUCP, locally submitted mail) for filtering. Two
    example mail filters are included - one written in C that uses
    threads, and a Perl-based filter. The system administrator can
    also enable the ability for individual mail recipients to
    specify their own mail filtering rules, using a scripting
    language (implemented by <code>maildrop</code>, see below).
    Mail filtering is implemented as an integral part of the mail
    server. Unwanted mail is rejected, and is not accepted by the
    <em>Courier</em> mail server for delivery (the external mail
    relay receives the error, and it becomes the external relay's
    problem as to what to do with unwanted junk mail).</li>

    <li>Partial ability to import <code>sendmail</code>'s aliases
    file, but not all aspects of <code>sendmail</code>'s aliasing
    is supported - like delivering to programs, for example. Still,
    most simple <code>aliases</code> files should be usable.</li>

    <li>Optional ability to import most of <code>Qmail</code>'s
    <code>.qmail</code> files (<em>Courier</em> mail server uses an
    almost 100% compatible local mail delivery instruction
    format).</li>

    <li>Most major components of the <em>Courier</em> mail server
    can be installed in non-default directories, allowing extreme
    customization for your particular environment.</li>

    <li>You can set a maximum number of messages to deliver
    simultaneously to the same host. This, in fact, is strongly
    encouraged so that a single nonfunctioning domain does not take
    up all available delivery slots. Rate limiting is implemented
    in the main scheduler, and applies to any transport mechanism,
    not just ESMTP.</li>

    <li>Mailing list administrators can specify a backup relay and
    have mail that's not immediately deliverable offloaded to a
    backup server (this feature needs testing/feedback).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>However, it is also important to note what the
  <em>Courier</em> mail server does not have or will not
  support:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>.forward</code> files are partially supported. The
    <em>Courier</em> mail server can import most basic
    <code>/etc/aliases</code> files from <a target="_blank" href=
    "http://www.sendmail.org">sendmail</a>, but sendmail's
    <code>.forward</code> and <code>/etc/aliases</code> files are
    simply not 100% compatible with the <em>Courier</em> mail
    server's security model. Most <code>.forward</code> and
    <code>/etc/aliases</code> files should be acceptable, but some
    may not.</li>

    <li><code>ETRN</code> is not, and will never be implemented.
    It's a hack, and is functionally incompatible with the
    <em>Courier</em> mail server's internal message dispatcher. If
    a mail node does not have constant network connectivity, there
    are better ways of arranging for mail transport than ETRN. The
    transient mail node should download mail via IMAP, or maybe
    even UUCP.<br /></li>

    <li>Workarounds for known defects in other mail software. The
    <em>Courier</em> mail server will not accept mail with raw
    8-bit characters in the headers, because they are illegal.
    There are well-defined protocols that must be used to encode
    8-bit text in mail headers. Non-compliant messages may result
    in the <em>Courier</em> mail server itself issuing corrupted
    delivery status notifications, or mishandling the message in
    several other ways. Because of that corrupted mail will simply
    not be accepted. Neither will the <em>Courier</em> mail server
    deliver mail to domains with improperly-defined MX records,
    even though other mail servers ignore the bad data.
    Additionally, certain popular IMAP mail clients are known to
    not work with the <em>Courier</em> mail server's IMAP server,
    due to an improper IMAP implementation by the mail client.</li>

    <li>Scripting language for rewriting mail headers. Mail
    rewriting rules are hardcoded, and are expected to be
    sufficient in most cases. If you have an unusual situation that
    requires some oddball header rewriting, you'll have to
    implement it yourself.</li>

    <li>Support for mbox mailboxes in the POP3, IMAP, and webmail
    components. They support maildirs only. There are plenty of
    existing servers out there that read mbox mailboxes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Requirements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>A C++ compiler, <code>egcs</code> is recommended. Most of
    the <em>Courier</em> mail server are written in C, but several
    major sections are written in C++.</li>

    <li>GNU make. Other <code>make</code>s may work, but that's not
    guaranteed.</li>

    <li>Either the GDBM or Berkeley DB library must be available.
    Only certain versions of Berkeley DB API are supported, because
    the Berkeley DB API often changes (tested with 2.4.14 and
    1.8.5). GDBM is the recommended library.</li>

    <li>Perl 5.</li>

    <li>The file system must support FIFOs. At least the file
    system that stores the mail queue must be able to support
    FIFOs. The <em>Courier</em> mail server will not work with
    AFS.</li>

    <li>Filesystem domain sockets must be available.</li>

    <li>Some optional components have additional dependencies -
    notably the additional software required for faxmail support
    (see above).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Additional information</h2>Here is a somewhat more detailed
  overview of the <em>Courier</em> mail server's less prominent
  features:

  <h3>Upgrade path</h3>The <em>Courier</em> mail server can be
  installed on systems that were previously running sendmail or
  Qmail. Please note that the <em>Courier</em> mail server will be
  able to support most major features of both servers, however the
  <em>Courier</em> mail server is not, and will never be a
  100%-compatible replacement for either sendmail or Qmail. The
  <em>Courier</em> mail server does not implement several legacy
  features of either MTA, and there are no plans to implement them
  in the future. The key differences are:

  <ul>
    <li>sendmail</li>
  </ul>

  <p>A local mail delivery agent, such as <code>procmail</code>,
  should be used for maximum compatibility with sendmail.</p>

  <p>The <em>Courier</em> mail server expects system mailboxes to
  be in the users' home directories. If your system mailboxes are
  all stored separately, in <code>/var/spool/mail</code> or
  somewhere else, you'll need to use a local delivery agent such as
  <code>procmail</code>.</p>

  <p>The <em>Courier</em> mail server uses a filesystem lock on
  mailbox files, The <em>Courier</em> mail server does not support
  old-fashioned dot-locking. If you need dot-locking, use
  <code>procmail</code> or <code>maildrop</code> (included).</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Qmail</li>
  </ul>

  <p>A configuration switch allows the <em>Courier</em> mail server
  to read <code>$HOME/.qmail</code> files, however the
  <em>Courier</em> mail server's implementation is not 100%
  identical to Qmail's. The <em>Courier</em> mail server's
  <code>aliases</code> file is also used to implement Qmail-style
  virtual domains. A simple Perl script can be used to convert
  Qmail's <code>control/virtualdomains</code> into
  <code>aliases</code> entries.</p>

  <p>The <em>Courier</em> mail server supports Maildirs
  natively.</p>

  <p>The <em>Courier</em> mail server can use the
  <code>maildrop</code> mail filter as a local mail delivery agent.
  <code>maildrop</code> is optional, but, if used, The
  <em>Courier</em> mail server will take advantage of certain
  <code>maildrop</code>-specific features which optimize local mail
  delivery.</p>

  <h2>Mail filters</h2>The <em>Courier</em> mail server has hooks
  for optional, site-defined, mail filters. You'll have to write
  them yourself, though. The administrator-defined mail filters can
  block the message from being accepted by the <em>Courier</em>
  mail server (if messages comes in via SMTP, the SMTP server will
  reject it). The <em>Courier</em> mail server can also be
  configured to pause for a short period of time before attempting
  to deliver a message. If the mail filter detects a slew of
  duplicate messages coming in, the mail filter can block all
  future copies, and manually bounce the handful of copies from the
  queue. The system administrator can selectively enable filtering
  for any individual mail source (ESMTP, locally submitted mail,
  UUCP). The system administrator can also optionally enable
  recipient-specified mail filters. With recipient-specified mail
  filtering enabled, any local mail recipient can install an
  arbitrary mail filter to selectively accept or reject mail based
  on any criteria.

  <p>Currently the mail filtering API is not very well documented,
  but it's there.</p>

  <h2>ESMTP extensions</h2>The <em>Courier</em> mail server
  implements <code>AUTH</code>, <code>PIPELINING</code>,
  <code><a href="courierdsn.html">DSN</a></code>,
  <code>SIZE</code>, and <code>8BITMIME</code> extensions to SMTP.
  The <em>Courier</em> mail server also includes a reference
  implementation of the experimental <code>XVERP</code> and
  <code>XEXDATA</code> extensions.

  <p>The <em>Courier</em> mail server is a closed mail relay by
  default. The <em>Courier</em> mail server cannot be accidentally
  configured as a completely open relay. A deliberate feat of
  stupidity is required for that to happen.</p>

  <h2>ESMTP BOFH</h2>The <em>Courier</em> mail server does not
  deliver mail to domains with broken MX records. The
  <em>Courier</em> mail server also refuses to accept any mail with
  a return address in a domain with broken MX records.

  <p>The <em>Courier</em> mail server can automatically blacklist
  domains whose mail servers reject delivery status
  notifications.</p>

  <h2>Header rewriting</h2>The <em>Courier</em> mail server will
  rewrite headers and MIME-ify messages whenever appropriate.
  Header rewriting logic is hardcoded in C, there is no header
  rewriting language as in sendmail. An interpreted language
  imposes a drastic speed penalty. The rewriting library is fairly
  simple, and the the standard rewriting rules will do for most
  situations.

  <p>The <em>Courier</em> mail server rejects messages with
  badly-formed or missing MIME headers. The <em>Courier</em> mail
  server rejects messages containing 8-bit characters in the
  headers, or messages that contain 8-bit content, but do not have
  the required MIME headers. Accepting malformed messages of that
  kind can result in the <em>Courier</em> mail server itself
  sending mail that violates the relevant RFCs, therefore
  <em>Courier</em> mail server will simply reject
  improperly-formatted messages. There are well-defined RFC
  standards that explicitly spell out how mail containing 8-bit
  content or 8-bit headers should be encoded, and those standards
  will have to be properly implemented by anyone that wishes their
  mail to be accepted.</p>

  <h2>Modularity</h2>Message scheduling, dispatching, and the
  actual transport mechanism are completely modularized. Different
  message transport mechanisms such as UUCP can be implemented in a
  simple plug-in fashion, however some C coding will be required.

  <h2>Message scheduling</h2>The <em>Courier</em> mail server
  supports VERPs, multiple recipients per message, and
  RFC1894-compliant delivery status notifications.

  <h2>Load limiting</h2>You can set a maximum number of messages to
  deliver simultaneously to the same host. This, in fact, is
  strongly encouraged so that a single nonfunctioning domain does
  not take up all available delivery slots. Rate limiting is
  implemented in the main scheduler, and applies to any transport
  mechanism, not just ESMTP.

  <h2>Automatic restarts and garbage cleanup</h2>The
  <em>Courier</em> mail server's scheduling engine restarts itself
  automatically, on a regular basis. This helps with memory
  fragmentation. The <em>Courier</em> mail server tries to restart
  itself during periods of system inactivity.

  <h2>Smart organization of the message queue and temporary
  directories</h2>The <em>Courier</em> mail server automatically
  creates subdirectories when necessary, and deletes them when
  they're empty. When there's a sudden peak in the number of
  messages added to the queue, directories used to store the
  messages grow in size to accomodate the additional entries. On
  many file systems, once those messages are deleted, the empty
  slack space in the directory is not reclaimed, and actually slows
  down subsequent directory operations. The <em>Courier</em> mail
  server automatically removes empty directories, reclaiming the
  slack space.

  <h2>Smart installation layout</h2>

  <p>The <em>Courier</em> mail server's configuration script will
  install the <em>Courier</em> mail server into
  <code>/usr/lib/courier</code> by default. Everything will go into
  several subdirectories there: the actual binaries, configuration
  files, the mail queue, manual pages, and auxiliary support files.
  Optional configuration switches allow pretty much every major
  subdirectory to be relocated anywhere else. For example, the Red
  Hat RPM package for the <em>Courier</em> mail server relocates
  the configuration files to <code>/etc/courier</code>, the manual
  pages to <code>/usr/man</code>, and the mail queue to
  <code>/var/spool/courier</code>.</p>

  <h2>Mailing lists</h2>

  <p>The <em>Courier</em> mail server can implement both sendmail
  and qmail-style address aliases. De-duping of sendmail-style
  aliases is automatic. The <em>Courier</em> mail server source
  distribution also includes a complete mailing list manager.</p>
