  <h2>Directory Layout</h2>In the following documentation, the
  variable ${COURIER_HOME}is set to <em>Courier</em>'s installation
  directory, and ${ARCH} is set to the target platform type, such
  as "i586-linux-gnu":

  <p><code>${COURIER_HOME}</code> is the main installation
  directory, everything lives under here.<br />
  <code>${COURIER_HOME}/ARCH</code> is a soft link to
  <code>${ARCH}</code><br />
  <code>${COURIER_HOME}/${ARCH}/bin</code> - binary files<br />
  <code>${COURIER_HOME}/${ARCH}/lib</code> - library files<br />
  <code>${COURIER_HOME}/bin</code> - mostly soft links to
  arch<code>/bin</code><br />
  <code>${COURIER_HOME}/lib</code> - mostly soft links to
  arch<code>/lib</code><br />
  <code>${COURIER_HOME}/man</code> - manual pages<br />
  <code>${COURIER_HOME}/local/config</code> - local
  configuration<br />
  <code>${COURIER_HOME}/local/msgs</code> - mail queue - messages
  and control files<br />
  <code>${COURIER_HOME}/local/msgq</code> - mail queue - control
  files, sorted by next scheduled delivery attempt time<br />
  <code>${COURIER_HOME}/local/tmp</code> - temporary directory</p>

  <p>All directories can be softlinks, or mount points, EXCEPT that
  <code>local/msg[sq]</code> and <code>local/tmp</code> must be on
  the same filesystem.</p>

  <h3>Ownership and permissions.</h3>This documentation assumes
  that <em>Courier</em> is installed as user 'mail', group 'mail'. Unless
  otherwise specified below, everything is owned by <em>Courier</em>'s
  user/group. Global read/execute permissions on everything. Write
  permissions to user and group.

  <p>In <code>local/msg[sq]</code> the userid of the control and
  the message file are that of the user who created the
  message.</p>

  <h2>Programs/Modules</h2><code>courierctl</code> scripts - these
  scripts start and stop <code>courierd</code>, and performs other
  administrative functions.

  <blockquote>
    <code>courierctl.start</code> scripts - these scripts start
    courierd. They do NOT start any input module daemons, that must
    be done separately. Note that this command only begins the
    startup process. courierd may fail to start for some reason,
    you will need to check your system logs to verify that courierd
    is properly running.

    <p><code>courierctl.stop</code> - this command stops courierd.
    courierd is stopped cold, interrupting any pending
    deliveries.</p>

    <p><code>courierctl.restart</code> - this command restarts
    courierd by sending it a SIGHUP. courierd will suspend starting
    any new deliveries, then wait for all current deliveries to
    finish, then restart itself. This action is necessary after
    making certain configuration changes.</p>
  </blockquote><code>courierd</code> - the main scheduling daemon.
  The heart of <em>Courier</em> is just a raw scheduler that figures out
  when to attempt to deliver messages that are in the queue. There
  will actually be two <code>courierd</code> processes running, at
  the same time. <code>courierd</code> is started and stopped by
  <code>courierctl</code>.

  <h3>Modules</h3>The <code>courierd</code> scheduling daemon is
  transport neutral, and external modules are used to submit
  messages to courierd, and attempt to deliver messages at regular
  intervals.&nbsp; The term 'input module' refers to an external
  module that submits messages to courierd, and 'output module'
  refers to an external module that delivers messages. The term
  'transport module', or a plain 'module' refers to both an input
  module and an output module for the same platform, which usually
  come together. For example, <em>Courier</em> typically receives and sends
  mail via ESMTP, however, it is possible to adjust the default
  configuration so that ESMTP is only used to receive mail. For
  sending, mail gets delivered using some other protocol.

  <p>Output module are started by <code>courierd</code>, and
  communicate with <code>courierd</code> via pipes. Output module
  are notified which messages must be delivered, and to which
  addresses. <em>Courier</em> may send multiple messages to the same output
  module, without waiting for an acknowledgement that an attempted
  delivery for previous messages has been made.</p>

  <p>E-mail addresses that appear in the message's headers, and
  which are listed in the message's delivery envelope, are stored
  in a "canonical" format. E-mail messages that come from an input
  module have their addresses rewritten from the transport-specific
  format to the canonical format. E-mail messages which are sent to
  be delivered to an output module have their addresses rewritten
  to the canonical format.</p>

  <p>The canonical format is the format for E-mail addresses that
  is used by <em>Courier</em>'s system. Therefore, messages that are
  delivered to local mailboxes do not undergo header or address
  rewriting.</p>

  <p>Messages are submitted to the <em>Courier</em> server by running the
  ${COURIER_HOME}/bin/submit, which takes care of rewriting
  addresses from the transport format to canonical format. When an
  output module receives a message to deliver from <em>Courier</em>'s queue,
  the E-mail addresses in the message will be in the canonical
  format, and the output module is responsible for rewriting
  addresses in the headers into the transport-specific format. The
  output module can take advantage of a set of library functions
  which automate this process.</p>

  <h3>The rewrite library</h3>Each transport module comes with a
  small library file which provides functions to rewrite addresses
  between the canonical format and the transport specific format.
  Also, the library provides a function that examines a canonical
  E-mail address and indicates if the address can be delivered to
  by the output module. When attempting to deliver a message,
  <em>Courier</em> calls each transport module's delivery function, until it
  finds one that accepts this E-mail address for delivery. Then,
  <em>Courier</em> notifies the output module to deliver the message to this
  address.

  <p>On platforms that support dynamically-opened shared libraries,
  <em>Courier</em> can be compiled to use shared libraries. This allows
  rewriting functions to be modified, and have the changes take
  effect without fully shutting down <em>Courier</em>. Otherwise, they can
  be compiled as regular, statically linked libraries.</p>

  <h3>The <code>submit</code> program</h3><code>submit</code> is
  used to submit a message into <em>Courier</em>'s scheduling queue.
  <code>submit</code> is not invoked directly. <code>submit</code>
  does not have any global read or execute permissions, only user
  and group permissions, therefore it must be invoked by a process
  that executes at least as group mail. <code>submit</code>
  provides the functionality most transports will need in order to
  submit messages into the queue. Submit accepts several options,
  and one argument: the name of the input module submitting the
  message. <code>submit</code> also reads the environment,
  therefore the environment variables must be scrubbed before
  invoking <code>submit</code>. <code>submit</code> communicates
  via standard input and output with the module to read the
  identify of the sender and the recipients of an E-mail message,
  and the message contents. <code>submit</code> enforces message
  size limits and may reject the sender or any recipient. Options
  are:

  <blockquote>
    <code>-expn=address</code> - do not accept any message, just
    attempt to 'expand' this address.

    <p><code>-vrfy=address</code> - do not accept any message, just
    attempt to 'verify' this address.</p>

    <p><code>-verp</code> - use VERP-encoded envelope sender
    address.</p>
  </blockquote><code>submit</code> opens the shared libraries,
  reads the E-mail addresses of the sender and the recipient, reads
  the message itself, and rewrites all addresses to the canonical
  format by running the module's address rewriting function in the
  shared library. <code>submit</code> may perform other
  adjustments, such as adding the <code>Date:</code> or the
  <code>Message-ID:</code> header, or adding MIME headers.
  <code>submit</code> also checks if any recipient is a
  system-defined alias, and adds the alias's list of addresses to
  the recipient list. <code>submit</code> will also try to remove
  duplicate E-mail addresses from the recipient list, wherever
  possible.&nbsp; Wherever possible, <code>submit</code> will
  reject E-mail addresses that it knows are not valid.

  <p><code>mailq</code> - display current mail queue for the
  running user (or the entire queue, if invoked as root). Since
  individual control files are owned by the originating user. mailq
  simply prints out the contents of every control file it can
  open.</p>

  <blockquote>
    -s - sort messages by starting time. With many messages, this
    can eat up memory, and CPU cycles. The list is not sorted, by
    default.
  </blockquote><code>reformime</code> - standalone program that can
  be used by module to implement some header rewriting. I am
  borrowing the reformime tool from the maildrop package, which
  contains complete documentation for reformime.

  <p>That's it. Other program modules come as a part of plug-in
  transport module. For example, the SMTP transport doesn't have to
  be installed, resulting in <em>Courier</em> being used to just deliver
  mail on a single system. Or, only the SMTP output module can be
  installed, so that the machine will be able to send mail via
  SMTP, but not receive it. Or, only the SMTP input module can be
  installed, so that the machine can receive mail via SMTP, but not
  send it (which also means that bounces can't be delivered, so
  they double-bounce to postmaster).</p>

  <h3>Environment variables used by submit</h3>The
  <code>submit</code> program also reads the following variables
  from the environment:

  <p><code>SPAMDATAFILTER=pathname</code> - run this spam filter.
  After receiving this message, run the indicated program. In
  addition to the environment variables inherited by submit, submit
  sets MODULE to the name of the input module, before running the
  spam filter. Please note that the program is run with the
  user/group id of the submit process!</p>

  <p><code>MIME=option</code> - sets options for mime rewriting.
  The options are: none - no mime rewriting whatsoever; 7bit -
  convert 8bit mime sections to quoted-printable; 8bit - convert
  quoted-printable to 8bit.</p>

  <p><code>NOADDMSGID</code> - if set, submit will not add a
  <code>Message-Id:</code> header, if the message does not have
  it.</p>

  <p><code>NOADDDATE</code> - if set, submit will not add a
  <code>Date:</code> header, if the message doesn't have it.</p>

  <p><code>NOADDRREWRITE</code> - if set, submit will not rewrite any
  <code>From:</code>, <code>To:</code>, and <code>Cc:</code> header, or check
  whether the message has a <code>DKIM-Signature:</code> before doing so.</p>

  <p><code>SIZELIMIT</code> - maximum size of a message in bytes.
  Larger messages are rejected. If this environment variable is not
  set, <em>Courier</em> will read the <code>control/sizelimit</code> file.
  If <code>control/sizelimit</code> does not exist, <em>Courier</em> will
  use "0". "0" is used to specify that there is no maximum message
  size limit.</p>

  <h2>Queue</h2>Each message in the queue is represented by two
  files, the control file, and the message file. The message file
  contains the actual message, headers and body. The message is
  stored in the 'local' format, that is, the addresses in the
  headers are rewritten into the format used by the local system.
  The control file contains ancillary information about the
  message: the sender, the recipient, and its current status. The
  control file is called "Cnnnn" or "Cnnnn.tttttt", and the message
  file is called "Mnnnn". In both cases, nnnn represents the inode
  number of the control file, so that the inherent uniqueness of
  inodes is used to generate unique filenames. 'tttttt' is the time
  when the the next delivery attempt for the message is due. tttttt
  is the message's next scheduled attempted delivery date,
  expressed as number of seconds used by the <b>time()</b> system
  call. More on that later.
