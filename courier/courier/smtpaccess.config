# Default access policies for courieresmtpd

# By default, enable relaying for localhost.

127.0.0.1	allow,RELAYCLIENT

# IPv6 addresses are explicitly prefixed by a :, hence the odd-looking
# leading : above.

# Also, enable relaying for 10.0.0.0/8 and 192.168.0.0/16

10	allow,RELAYCLIENT
192.168	allow,RELAYCLIENT

# And for fe80::/10. We have to list out the following novel, if we do not
# have the Net::CIDR Perl module installed:
#
# :fe80	allow,RELAYCLIENT
# :fe81	allow,RELAYCLIENT
#
# ...
#
# :febf allow,RELAYCLIENT
#
# But with Net::CIDR we can simply do this, and call it a day:
#
# :fe80::/10	allow,RELAYCLIENT

# Use the following entry to deny connections from bad IP addresses
#
# 192.168.5	deny

# Another way to block mail from IP addresses is by initializing the
# BLOCK variable to a non-empty value.  This is enforced in submit.
#
# 192.168.5	allow,BLOCK="550 Shoo! Go away!"

# If 192.168.2.3 is listed in a blocklist that initializes the BLOCK
# environment variable, and you wish to whitelist the IP address, just
# set BLOCK to an empty value, like this:
#
# 192.168.2.3	allow,BLOCK
