# This configuration file configures the courierldapaliasd process.
#
# courierldapaliasd, essentially, is an implementation of aliasing against
# an LDAP directory.  See the makealiases(8) manual page for the description
# of aliasing.  Aliasing, essentially, is rerouting mail addressed to one
# address to another address.  Mail headers are not touched, only the
# the recipient address is rewritten.  Here's how it works.
# Courier receives a recipient address of user@domain.com, and issues an
# LDAP search for "mail=user@domain.com".  If the LDAP search returns a
# record, the "maildrop" attribute specifies the address to use instead of
# user@domain.com.  For example:
#
# dn: mail=user@example.com, dc=example.com
# mail: user@example.com
# maildrop: user@server1.example.com
#
# Multiple maildrop attributes are allowed, and the message gets sent to
# each maildrop, essentially implementing a mailing list.
#
# The format of this file must be as follows:
#
# field[spaces|tabs]value
#
# That is, the name of the field, followed by spaces or tabs, followed by
# field value.  No trailing spaces.
#
# Here are the fields:
#
##NAME: LDAP_ALIAS:0
#
# Whether or not use courierldapaliasd at all.  Courier is shipped by default
# with courierldapaliasd turned off, and you enable it by setting LDAP_ALIAS
# to 1

LDAP_ALIAS		0

##NAME: LDAP_LOCATION:2
#
# Location of your LDAP server:

LDAP_URI	ldap://ldap.example.com:389

##NAME: LDAP_NUMPROCS:0
#
# Number of courierldapaliasd processes to start (there's always an extra
# cleanup process)

LDAP_NUMPROCS		5

##NAME: LDAP_BASEDN:0
#
# LDAP_BASEDN is the base where LDAP search starts from:

LDAP_BASEDN		organizationalUnit=maildrops, dc=example.com

##NAME: LDAP_BINDINFO:1
#
# You MAY need to specify the login and password for LDAP.  Because you've got
# a password here, authldaprc should not be world-readable!!!
#

LDAP_BINDDN		cn=administrator, dc=example.com
LDAP_BINDPW		penguin

##NAME: LDAP_TIMEOUT:0
#
# Timeout for the LDAP search.

LDAP_TIMEOUT		5

##NAME: LDAP_MAIL:0
#
# If you want to search on some other attribute, other than "mail", change the
# following:

LDAP_MAIL		mail

##NAME: LDAP_MAILDROP:0
#
# If you want to read maildrops from some other attribute, other than
# "maildrop", change the following:

LDAP_MAILDROP		maildrop

##NAME: LDAP_SOURCE:1
#
# If you want to create source-specific aliases, define LDAP_SOURCE like this:
#
# Then, for mail received via esmtp, the query would be something like
# (&(mail=[mail])(mailsource=esmtp)).  This allows something like this:
#
# LDAP_SOURCE   mailsource
#
# dn: mail=staff, dc=example.com
# mail: staff
# mailsource: local
# maildrop: tom
# maildrop: john
# maildrop: steve
#
# So that the address <staff> can only be used locally, a private mailing
# list.  If no records are found, the search is repeated as follows:
# (&(mail=[mail])(!(source=*))), which will search records without any
# source attribute.

LDAP_SOURCE

##NAME: LDAP_VIRTUALMAP:1
#
# courierldapaliasd can also map virtual domain to local accounts, like
# makealiases.  In makealiases, "@domain.com: luser" results in mail addressed
# to foobar@domain.com to be delivered to luser-foobar@localhost.  This only
# works for localhost.  To enable virtual domain mapping, uncomment the
# following two settings, LDAP_VDOMAIN and LDAP_VUSER:
#
# Then, you'll have something like this:
#
# dn: vdomain=domain.com, dc=example.com
# virtualdomain: vdomain.com
# virtualdomainuser: luser
#
# You can also specify source-based virtual domains, by the way.
#
# LDAP_VDOMAIN		virtualdomain
# LDAP_VUSER		virtualdomainuser

LDAP_VDOMAIN
LDAP_VUSER
