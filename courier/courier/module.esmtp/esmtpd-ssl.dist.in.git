#  This configuration file sets various options for the Courier-SMTP server
#  when used to handle SSL ESMTP connections.
#
#  SSL and non-SSL connections are handled by a dedicated instance of the
#  couriertcpd daemon.  If you are accepting both SSL and non-SSL ESMTP
#  connections, you will start two instances of couriertcpd, one on the
#  ESMTP port 25, and another one on the ESMTP-SSL port 465.

##NAME: install_prefix:0
#
# Do not change the following settings.

prefix=@prefix@
exec_prefix=@exec_prefix@

##NAME: BOFHCHECKDNS:0
#
#  Comment out the following line in order to accept mail with a bad
#  return address.

BOFHCHECKDNS=1

##NAME: BOFHNOEXPN:1
#
#  Set BOFHNOEXP to 1 to disable EXPN

BOFHNOEXPN=0

##NAME: BOFHNOVRFY:1
#
#  Set BOFHNOVERIFY to disable VRFY

BOFHNOVRFY=0

##NAME: TARPIT:1
#
#  Set TARPIT to 0 to disable tarpitting

TARPIT=1

##NAME: NOADDMSGID:0
#
#  The following environment variables keep Courier from adding
#  default Date: and Message-ID: header to messages which do not have them.
#  If you would like to add default headers only for mail from certain
#  IP address ranges, you can override them in couriertcpd access file,
#  see couriertcpd(8).

NOADDMSGID=1

##NAME: NOADDDATE:0
#

NOADDDATE=1

##NAME: NOADDRREWRITE:0
#
# Don't rewrite To:, From:, and Cc: headers.  Set to 2 in order to omit
# rewriting them only if there is a DKIM-Signature.

NOADDRREWRITE=0

##NAME: ESMTP_LOG_DIALOG:0
#
#  If set, log the esmtp dialog.

ESMTP_LOG_DIALOG=0

##NAME: AUTH_REQUIRED:0
#
# Set AUTH_REQUIRED to 1 in order to force the client to use ESMTP
# authentication.  You can override AUTH_REQUIRED on a per-IP address basis
# using smtpaccess.  See makesmtpaccess(8).

AUTH_REQUIRED=0

##NAME: SSLPORT:0
#
#  Options in the esmtpd-ssl configuration file AUGMENT the options in the
#  esmtpd configuration file.  First the esmtpd configuration file is read,
#  then the esmtpd-ssl configuration file, so we do not have to redefine
#  anything.
#
#  However, some things do have to be redefined.  The port number is
#  specified by SSLPORT, instead of PORT.  The default port is port 465.
#
#  Multiple port numbers can be separated by commas.  When multiple port
#  numbers are used it is possibly to select a specific IP address for a
#  given port as "ip.port".  For example, "127.0.0.1.900,192.168.0.1.900"
#  accepts connections on port 900 on IP addresses 127.0.0.1 and 192.168.0.1
#  The SSLADDRESS setting is a default for ports that do not have
#  a specified IP address.

SSLPORT=465

##NAME: SSLADDRESS:0
#
#  Address to listen on, can be set to a single IP address.
#
# SSLADDRESS=127.0.0.1

SSLADDRESS=0

##NAME: SSLPIDFILE:0
#
#

SSLPIDFILE=@piddir@/esmtpd-ssl.pid

##NAME: ESMTPDSSLSTART:0
#
#  Whether or not to start ESMTP over SSL on esmtps port:

ESMTPDSSLSTART=NO

##NAME: COURIERTLS:0
#
# The following variables configure ESMTP over SSL.  If OpenSSL or GnuTLS
# is available during configuration, the couriertls helper gets compiled, and
# upon installation a dummy TLS_CERTFILE gets generated. courieresmtpd will
# automatically advertise the ESMTP STARTTLS extension if both TLS_CERTFILE
# and COURIERTLS exist.
#
# WARNING: Peer certificate verification has NOT yet been tested.  Proceed
# at your own risk.  Only the basic SSL/TLS functionality is known to be
# working. Keep this in mind as you play with the following variables.
#

COURIERTLS=@bindir@/couriertls

##NAME: TLS_PRIORITY:0
#
# GnuTLS setting only
#
# Set TLS protocol priority settings (GnuTLS only)
#
# DEFAULT: NORMAL:-CTYPE-OPENPGP
#
# TLS_PRIORITY="NORMAL:-CTYPE-OPENPGP"
#
# This setting is also used to select the available ciphers.
#
# The actual list of available ciphers depend on the options GnuTLS was
# compiled against. The possible ciphers are:
#
# AES256, 3DES, AES128, ARC128, ARC40, RC2, DES, NULL
#
# Also, the following aliases:
#
# HIGH -- all ciphers that use more than a 128 bit key size
# MEDIUM -- all ciphers that use a 128 bit key size
# LOW -- all ciphers that use fewer than a 128 bit key size, the NULL cipher
#        is not included
# ALL -- all ciphers except the NULL cipher
#
# See GnuTLS documentation, gnutls_priority_init(3) for additional
# documentation.

##NAME: TLS_PROTOCOL:0
#
# TLS_PROTOCOL sets the protocol version.  The possible versions are:
#
# OpenSSL:
#
# SSL3 - SSLv3
# SSL23 - all protocols (including TLS 1.x protocols)
# TLSv1 - TLS1
# TLSv1.1 - TLS1.1
# TLSv1.2 - TLS1.2
#
# SSL3+, TLSv1+, TLSv1.1+, and TLSv1.2+ - the corresponding protocol, and all
# higher protocols.
#
# The default value is TLSv1+

##NAME: TLS_CIPHER_LIST:0
#
# TLS_CIPHER_LIST optionally sets the list of ciphers to be used by the
# OpenSSL library.  In most situations you can leave TLS_CIPHER_LIST
# undefined
#
# OpenSSL:
#
# TLS_CIPHER_LIST="TLSv1:HIGH:!LOW:!MEDIUM:!EXP:!NULL:!aNULL@STRENGTH"

##NAME: TLS_MIN_DH_BITS:0
#
# TLS_MIN_DH_BITS=n
#
# GnuTLS only:
#
# Set the minimum number of acceptable bits for a DH key exchange.
#
# GnuTLS's compiled-in default is 727 bits (as of GnuTLS 1.6.3). Some server
# have been encountered that offer 512 bit keys. You may have to set
# TLS_MIN_DH_BITS=512 here, if necessary.

##NAME: TLS_TIMEOUT:0
# TLS_TIMEOUT is currently not implemented, and reserved for future use.
# This is supposed to be an inactivity timeout, but its not yet implemented.
#

##NAME: TLS_CERTFILE:0
#
# TLS_CERTFILE - certificate to use.  TLS_CERTFILE is required for SSL/TLS
# servers, and is optional for SSL/TLS clients.  TLS_CERTFILE is usually
# treated as confidential, and must not be world-readable. Set TLS_CERTFILE
# instead of TLS_DHCERTFILE if this is a garden-variety certificate
#
# VIRTUAL HOSTS ON THE SAME IP ADDRESS.
#
# Install each certificate $TLS_CERTFILE.domain, so if TLS_CERTFILE is set to
# /etc/certificate.pem, then you'll need to install the actual certificate
# files as /etc/certificate.pem.www.example.com,
# /etc/certificate.pem.www.domain.com and so on. Then, create a link from
# $TLS_CERTFILE to whichever certificate you consider to be the main one,
# for example:
# /etc/certificate.pem => /etc/certificate.pem.www.example.com
#
# IP-BASED VIRTUAL HOSTS:
#
# There may be a need to support older SSL/TLS client that don't support
# virtual hosts on the same IP address, and require a dedicated IP address
# for each SSL/TLS host. If so, install each certificate file as
# $TLS_CERTFILE.aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd, where "aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd" is the IP address
# for the certificate's domain name. So, if TLS_CERTFILE is set to
# /etc/certificate.pem, then you'll need to install the actual certificate
# files as /etc/certificate.pem.192.168.0.2, /etc/certificate.pem.192.168.0.3
# and so on, for each IP address.
#
# In all cases, $TLS_CERTFILE needs to be linked to one of the existing
# certificate files.

TLS_CERTFILE=@mydatadir@/esmtpd.pem

##NAME: TLS_DHPARAMS:0
#
# TLS_DHPARAMS - DH parameter file.
#
TLS_DHPARAMS=@mydatadir@/dhparams.pem

##NAME: TLS_TRUSTCERTS:0
#
# TLS_TRUSTCERTS=pathname - load trusted certificates from pathname.
# pathname can be a file or a directory. If a file, the file should
# contain a list of trusted certificates, in PEM format. If a
# directory, the directory should contain the trusted certificates,
# in PEM format, one per file and hashed using OpenSSL's c_rehash
# script. TLS_TRUSTCERTS is used by SSL/TLS clients (by specifying
# the -domain option) and by SSL/TLS servers (TLS_VERIFYPEER is set
# to PEER or REQUIREPEER).

TLS_TRUSTCERTS=@cacerts@

##NAME: TLS_VERIFYPEER:0
#
# TLS_VERIFYPEER - how to verify client certificates.  The possible values of
# this setting are:
#
# NONE - do not verify anything
#
# PEER - verify the client certificate, if one's presented
#
# REQUIREPEER - require a client certificate, fail if one's not presented
#
#
TLS_VERIFYPEER=NONE

##NAME: TLS_EXTERNAL:0
#
# To enable SSL certificate-based authentication:
#
# 1) TLS_TRUSTCERTS must be set to a pathname that holds your certificate
#    authority's SSL certificate
#
# 2) TLS_VERIFYPEER=PEER or TLS_VERIFYPEER=REQUIREPEER (the later settings
#    requires all SSL clients to present a certificate, and rejects
#    SSL/TLS connections without a valid cert).
#
# 3) Set TLS_EXTERNAL, below, to the subject field that holds the login ID.
#    Example:
#
#  TLS_EXTERNAL=emailaddress
#
# The above example retrieves the login ID from the "emailaddress" subject
# field. The certificate's emailaddress subject must match exactly the login
# ID in the courier-authlib database.

##NAME: SYSLOGNAME:0
#
# Name that courieresmtpd uses to log to syslog
#
# SYSLOGNAME=courieresmtpd

##NAME: MAXDAEMONS:0
#
#  Maximum number of daemons started
#

MAXDAEMONS=40

##NAME: MAXPERC:0
#
#  Maximum number of connections accepted from the same C address block
#

MAXPERC=5

##NAME: MAXPERIP:0
#
#
#  Maximum number of connections accepted from the same IP address

MAXPERIP=5
